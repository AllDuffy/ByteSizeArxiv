       "  'summary': 'Despite superior training outcomes, adaptive optimization methods such as\\nAdam, Adagrad or RMSprop have been found to generalize poorly compared to\\nStochastic gradient descent (SGD). These methods tend to perform well in the\\ninitial portion of training but are outperformed by SGD at later stages of\\ntraining. We investigate a hybrid strategy that begins training with an\\nadaptive method and switches to SGD when appropriate. Concretely, we propose\\nSWATS, a simple strategy which switches from Adam to SGD when a triggering\\ncondition is satisfied. The condition we propose relates to the projection of\\nAdam steps on the gradient subspace.

It has the advantages over the well-known mean\\nshift algorithm that it is feasible in high-dimensional vector spaces\\nand results in uniquely, well deﬁned modes. Moreover, without any\\nadditional computational eﬀort it may yield a multi-scale hierarchy\\nof clusterings. The time complexity is just O(n\\nn). Resulting com-\\nputing times range from seconds for 104 objects to minutes for 105\\nobjects and to less than an hour for 106 objects. The space complex-\\nity is just O(n). The procedure is well suited for ﬁnding large sets\\nof small clusters and is thereby a candidate to analyze thousands of\\nclusters in millions of objects.\\n\\n√\\n\\nThe kNN mode seeking procedure can be used for active learning\\nby assigning the clusters to the class of the modal objects of the clus-\\nters. Its feasibility is shown by some examples with up to 1.5 million\\nhandwritten digits. The obtained classiﬁcation results based on the\\nclusterings are compared with those obtained by the nearest neigh-\\nbor rule and the support vector classiﬁer based on the same labeled\\nobjects for training.\\nIt can be concluded that using the clustering\\nstructure for classiﬁcation can be signiﬁcantly better than using the\\ntrained classiﬁers. A drawback of using the clustering for classiﬁca-\\ntion, however, is that no classiﬁer is obtained that may be used for\\nout-of-sample objects.\\n\\n1\\n\\n\\x0c1\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nMode seeking clustering is based on ﬁnding the modes of the estimated prob-\\nability density function of a given set of objects. For every mode a cluster is\\ndeﬁned consisting of all objects for which the density gradient followed from\\nthat object arrives at the particular mode. The basic idea can be traced back\\nto two papers by Fukunaga et al. [5], [9] in the seventies. In order to be able\\nto handle arbitrarily shaped clusters non-parametric density estimates are\\nneeded. Fukunaga et al. considered the two well known ways: Parzen kernel\\ndensities as well as estimates based on the k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN).\\n\\nThe kernel density estimate has been studied extensively for mode seeking\\nclustering.\\nIt has been made most popular by the mean shift algorithm\\n[1]. This is based on gradient estimates computed from the derivative of\\nthe kernel function. For higher dimensionalities iteratively computing and\\nfollowing the gradient is a computationally intensive procedure. Moreover,\\nthe number of restarts that is needed is a multiple of the number of modes. A\\nrandomly selected subset of objects is used for starting the gradient searches.\\nThe mean shift procedure is particulary useful for low dimensional datasets\\nwith a small or moderate number of clusters. An additional problem to be\\nsolved is the selection of the kernel. A small one will result in many clusters,\\na large one will combine them and may yield a too smooth result. In practise\\nthis may be solved by running the entire procedure for a set of kernels.\\n\\nThe kNN mode seeking clustering as described in [3] is simpler, faster,\\nbut less accurate than the original proposal by Koontz and Fukunaga [9].\\nDensities are not exactly computed, but are just related to the distance to\\nthe k-th nearest neighbor. The smaller k, the higher the clustering resolution\\nand the more modes are found. Gradient steps are deﬁned by setting and\\nfollowing pointers from every object to the one with the highest density in\\nits neighborhood, which we will call the modal object 1. Consequently, after\\ncomputing all n × n distances between the n objects in a dataset all modes\\ncan be found by following the pointers from all objects. The computational\\neﬀort is negligible compared to the distance computations of the previous\\nstep. In [3] it is discussed how to avoid the storage of all distances.\\n\\nA big advantage of the proposal is that diﬀerent clustering resolutions\\nrelated to a set of neighborhood sizes k can be simultaneously computed\\nwithout the need of any recomputation. This can be achieved by just the\\ncost of storing multiple pointers, which is feasible as the full distance matrix\\nis not stored. The total space complexity is O(nd + nm) in which d is the\\nnumber of features and m is the number of neighborhood sizes.\\n\\nFrom the application point of view, kNN mode seeking has the advantage\\n\\n1The concept of modal objects has been used in a diﬀerent way outside statistical data\\nanalysis in the ﬁeld of natural languages by F. Moltmann, see, A Predicativist Semantics\\nof Modals Based on Modal Objects, Proc. of the Amsterdam Colloquium 2015.\\n\\n2\\n\\n\\x0cover the mean shift algorithm that an automatic scaling is included in a\\nk-nearest neighbor approach. Objects in less dense areas will be related to\\nmore distant objects than in high density regions. In the mean shift algorithm\\nkernels have the same shape over the entire vector space.\\n\\nIn this paper a fast procedure for kNN mode seeking is presented, eval-\\nIn Section 2 the fast\\nuated and applied to the labeling of large datasets.\\nalgorithm is discussed and it is shown that it approximates the same clus-\\nn instead of all n × n distances. This is\\ntering by computing just n ×\\nachieved by constructing a set of overlapping cells by which for every object\\nthe number of candidates that might belong to the k nearest neighbors is sig-\\nniﬁcantly reduced. Whether this approximation is appropriate depends on\\nthe structure of the data and the type of clusters to be searched and thereby\\non the application.\\n\\n√\\n\\nIn Section 3 various possibilities of the labeling of a large dataset are\\nconsidered based on mode seeking clustering. By using the labels of just\\nthe modal objects the clustering can be used for labeling all other objects,\\nresulting in an active labeling procedure. This classiﬁcation scheme can\\nbe improved by using the multi-level clustering property of the kNN mode\\nseeking procedure that is obtained by almost no additional computational\\neﬀort. The same structure can be used for including a reject option.\\n\\nThe proposed procedures are illustrated and evaluated is Section 4 by\\nsome of large datasets of handwritten characters ranging from 70000 objects\\nto almost 1,5 million objects. Computing times, cluster qualities (compared\\nto true labels) and classiﬁcation performances as a function of the number\\nof labeled objects (learning curves) are measured and graphically shown.\\nConclusions are summarized in the ﬁnal Section 5. The software and some\\ndataset used in this paper are publicly available [4].\\n\\n2 Fast kNN mode seeking algorithm\\n\\n2.1 The original kNN mode seeking algorithm\\n\\nIn the version of kNN mode seeking, as described in [3], object densities are\\ndeﬁned as the reverse of the distance to the k-th nearest neighbor. The below\\nalgorithm is used. It is good for very large datasets with n > 105 objects. All\\npairwise distances are needed two times. As n2 = 1010 distances cannot be\\nstored, they are computed twice. This is done for a set of m neighborhood\\nsizes k (e.g. m = 25) in parallel, by which nm densities and nm pointers have\\nto be stored. These are used to compute nm cluster indices for m diﬀerent\\nclustering resolutions of the n objects.\\n\\n1. S is the user supplied set of objects with size n.\\n2. K is a user deﬁned set of target neighborhood sizes K = {k1, k2, ...km}.\\n\\n3\\n\\n\\x0ci = 1/sik.\\n\\nSort them: si = sortj(dij)\\nStore density estimates ∀k ∈ K : f k\\n\\n3.

The neighborhoods themselves are not stored\\nin this algorithm. They are recomputed in the next loop 8-12 in order to ﬁnd,\\nfor every neighborhood size K, the objects with the highest densities. The\\npointers to objects with higher densities are, for all resolutions, followed in\\nthe iteration loop 13-16. This ﬁnal loop takes almost no time in comparison\\nwith the two other ones. In case the studied neighborhood sizes are small,\\ne.g. up to 100, the indices of the neighborhood objects can be stored in the\\nﬁrst loop. For that case, the computing time of the second loop becomes\\nnegligible too. As we are interested in larger neighborhood sizes this does\\nnot hold for the experiments described in Section 4.\\n\\nThe time complexity of this algorithm is at least O(n2) as in the ﬁrst loop\\nthe distances of all objects to all other ones have to be computed. As they\\nare not stored no use of symmetry can be made. Various proposals have been\\nmade to speed up the computation of the nearest neighbors, e.g. by the use\\nof k-d trees. They are especially eﬀective in low-dimensional spaces and for\\nan (approximative) determination of the ﬁrst nearest neighbor. They do not\\noﬀer a solution for ﬁnding the neighbors in a large neighborhood, which is\\nneeded to ﬁnd larger clusters.\\n\\nIn the remainder of this paper we will refer to this original kNN Mode\\n\\nSeeking algorithm by MS.\\n\\n2.2 The proposed fast kNN mode seeking algorithm\\n\\nThe original algorithm presented in Section 2.1 is slow for very large datasets\\ndue to its time complexity. Every object is compared with every other object.\\nFor measuring densities, however, it is suﬃcient to relate objects just with\\ntheir neighboring ones. If candidate neighborhood objects could be selected\\n\\n4\\n\\n\\x0cwithout inspecting them all, a speedup would be realized. In [2] a procedure\\nis presented which experimentally appeared to have a time complexity of\\nO(n1.14). This procedure, however, is based on a ﬁxed neighborhood size,\\nwhile the advantage of our procedure is that it can handle simultaneously\\na set of neighborhood sizes. Inspired by the result of [2] we developed the\\nfollowing procedure.\\n\\nFirst a small set P of m << n objects is selected, e.g. at random. It is\\nnot essential that P is a subset of the given dataset S, but its feature rep-\\nresentation should be in the same domain as S. Next the 1-nearest neighbor\\ngraph is computed in which every object in S points to its nearest neighbor\\nin P. In this way S is split into m subsets and the space is split into m cells.\\nFor this operation nm distance computations are needed. Cells contain on\\nthe average n/m objects but may have diﬀerent sizes. We name this set of\\nnon-overlapping cells the P-cells.\\n\\nFor suﬃciently small values of k (k << n/m) it is expected that the\\nk-nearest neighbors of an object are in the same cell. Consequently just\\nn(n/m) instead of n2 distances need to be computed in addition to ﬁnd for\\nevery object in S its k nearest neighbors.\\nIn total this demands thereby\\nat least nm + n(n/m) distance computations (somewhat more if some cells\\ncontain more objects than the average, which is to be expected). This is\\nn is chosen. The total number of distances that has to\\nminimum if m =\\nbe computed is thereby at least 2n\\n\\nn.\\n\\n√\\n\\n√\\n\\nIn every P-cell some objects may be close to the cell border and it might\\nthereby happen that some of their k nearest neighbors in the total dataset S\\nare in a neighboring cell and are thereby not considered. In order to reduce\\nthe probability that this happens we enlarged the set of candidates deﬁned\\nby all objects that share the same object in P as their 1-nearest neighbor in\\nP and change it to all objects that share the same object in P as belonging\\nto their set of c-nearest neighbors. This results in a set of overlapping cells,\\nto be called Q-cells, that contain in the order of cn/m objects. For every\\nP-cell there is a larger Q-cell that entirely contains the P-cell.\\n\\nThe neighborhood search in the fast mode seeking procedure will, for\\nevery object, be restricted to the objects in the Q-cell deﬁned by the P-\\nIf all Q-cells would contain exactly this\\ncell to which the object belongs.\\nnumber of objects the number of distance computations is now minimum\\ncn distance computations.

A fully random choice may result is some very small P-cells.\\nThis may result in a bad quality of the kNN search. For that reason we\\nremove the few P-cells that contain less than n/(3m) objects. In Section 4\\nsome real world examples are given comparing the fast algorithm with the\\noriginal one.\\n\\nIn the remainder of this paper we will refer to the fast kNN Mode Seeking\\nby FMS or FMS-c, in which c is the value of the complexity parameter. By\\ndefault c = 6.\\n\\n6\\n\\n\\x0c3 Classifying objects based on kNN mode seek-\\n\\ning clustering\\n\\nIn this section some ways are described to use kNN mode seeking clustering\\nfor the classiﬁcation of a large set of unlabeled objects using a small set of\\nlabeled ones. The clustering procedure is applied to the entire dataset. In\\ncase the objects to be labeled are determined by the clustering this results\\nin active learning.\\n\\n3.1 kNN mode seeking applied to active learning\\n\\nAn important application of kNN mode seeking is based on the property\\nthat clusters are represented by a single object, the modal object. This is\\nthe object with the highest estimated density in the corresponding cluster.\\nAll other objects in the cluster have a pointer to this one. Consequently\\na fast way of labeling the entire dataset is achieved by labeling the modal\\nobjects by a human expert, followed by assigning all objects to the class\\nof the modal object of their cluster. This may reduce the cost of labeling\\nconsiderably. Moreover, it is expected that the modal objects represent the\\ndataset well. Thereby the obtained classiﬁcation may be more accurate than\\na classiﬁer trained by a randomly selected training set of the same size. The\\nfollowing procedure is used:\\n\\n1. Perform MS or FMS clustering on the entire dataset using a set of values\\nfor k, e.g. k = 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 14, 20, 30, 50, 70, resulting in 10 diﬀerent\\nclusterings Ci, i = 1, 2, . . . , 10.\\n\\n2. Determine the number of clusters Ni for every clustering Ci.\\n3. Select an appropriate clustering Ci∗ w.r.t. the permissable cost of la-\\nbeling the Ni modal objects found for clustering Ci, i = 1, 2, . . . , 10.\\n\\n4. Label the Ni∗ modal objects of clustering Ci∗.\\n5. Assign for every cluster in clustering Ci∗ all objects to the class of their\\n\\nmodal object.\\n\\nThis can be considered as a way of active learning. Therefore we name\\nthe procedure MS-AL or FMS-AL. There are, however, some diﬀerences with\\nthe traditional active learning procedures as the above algorithm is a one-\\nstep procedure. There is no intermediate or ﬁnal classiﬁer computed that is\\nused to select additional objects to be labeled. It seems thereby to be most\\nappropriate for labeling a given dataset as all objects to be labeled are used\\nfor estimating the density of these objects. There is no prediction of densities\\nof future, not yet seen objects.\\n\\nIn the above algorithm several clusterings are found, but just a single one\\nis used: the one with an appropriate number of clusters. One may wonder\\n\\n7\\n\\n\\x0cwhether the other available clusterings cannot be used for improving the\\nclassiﬁcation. In the next subsections some possibilities are discussed.\\n\\n3.2 kNN mode seeking combined with multi-level\\n\\nconﬁdence based classiﬁcation\\n\\nIn the active learning classiﬁcation procedure as deﬁned above, all objects\\nwithin a cluster receive the same class assignments. The rationale behind it is\\nthat a cluster is expected to contain similar objects. In case more objects in a\\ncluster have known (or estimated) labels or class conﬁdences q(xt), assigning\\na cluster average of class conﬁdences to all objects in the cluster follows the\\nsame idea:\\n\\nqij(xt) =\\n\\n1\\n|Cij|\\n\\n(cid:88)\\n\\nxt∈Cij\\n\\nq(xt)\\n\\nHere qij(xt) is an estimated row vector of class conﬁdences based on cluster\\nCij, being cluster j of clustering i. Let Qi = [qi1; . . . ; qir] be the n × r matrix\\nof the class conﬁdences for the r classes of all n objects and let Ai be an\\nn × n matrix with\\n\\nAi\\n\\nt,t(cid:48) = 1/|Cij| if xt ∈ Cij ∧ xt(cid:48) ∈ Cij\\n\\n= 0 otherwise\\n\\nWe ranked the clusterings from low resolution to high resolution clusterings.\\nThe conﬁdences Qi+1 are estimated from the conﬁdences Qi of clustering\\nlevel i with less clusters by averaging the conﬁdences of level i according to\\nthe clustering of level i + 1:\\n\\nQi+1 = Ai+1Qi\\n\\nBy iterating over all clustering levels conﬁdence estimates can be obtained\\nfor all of them from an initial estimate. This can be obtained from the ﬁrst\\nlevel Q1 by active learning. On this level for every cluster the modal object is\\nselected and labeled. All objects in a cluster are given the same conﬁdence:\\none for the class of the label and zero for all other classes.\\n\\nThe described procedure of propagating and averaging conﬁdences is con-\\nsistent with the active learning procedure in which all objects receive the same\\nclass as the modal object. As on higher clustering levels some clusters may\\ncontain objects of diﬀerent lower resolution clusters the object conﬁdences\\nmay receive contributions of various classes.\\n\\nSeveral alternative updating schemes may be possible for a given a set of\\nclusterings. In playing around with one of the datasets discussed in Section 4\\n(the Block Letter dataset) the above procedure has been chosen for combining\\n\\n(1)\\n\\n(2)\\n\\n(3)\\n\\n(4)\\n\\n8\\n\\n\\x0cmulti-level clusterings based on FMS or MS for active learning. We name it\\nFMS-ALC, or MS-ALC if based on the MS clustering. The matrix A is large\\nbut sparse. In our implementation computations are made cluster by cluster\\navoiding the need to store A.\\n\\n3.3 Reject curves for kNN mode seeking classiﬁcation\\n\\nAs the active learning classiﬁers MS-ALC and FMS-ALC output conﬁdences,\\nthey may be used for rejecting objects with a low conﬁdence of the selected\\nclass (i.e. the class for which the corresponding element of q(x) is maximum).\\nIn Section 4 some examples will be shown. In a sequential active learning\\nscheme objects with a low classiﬁcation conﬁdence might be good candidates\\nfor additional labeling.\\n\\n3.4 Use of kMeans as a baseline procedure\\n\\nA good candidate for a comparative study of the properties of the proposed\\nFMS is the classical kMeans procedure [6]. It iteratively ﬁnds a preset number\\nof clusters, k, by updating cluster means. In order to obtain modal objects,\\nto label the clusters, the cluster procedure should be extended, e.g. by the\\ncomputation of cluster medoid: objects in the clusters that are most close\\nto the cluster means, see [7]. In our implementation medoid objects are just\\nused for labeling, the clustering is not changed. The total number of distance\\ncomputations is (ηk + 1)n if the algorithm runs for η iterations. For large\\ndatasets, η can be large before stability is reached. In practice the algorithm\\ncan be stopped prematurely obtaining an approximate clustering.\\n\\nNote that the parameter k has a diﬀerent meaning in the two algorithms,\\nkMeans and kNN mode seeking. In mode seeking k determines the size of\\nthe neighborhood used for setting pointers to objects with a higher density.\\nBy following the pointers the total number of modes (clusters, objects to\\nbe labeled) in the entire dataset may be considerably smaller than n/k.\\nThe kMeans algorithm on the other hand will result in k clusters (in some\\nimplementations, not in ours, a few clusters might be lost).\\n\\nLike MS or FMS, kMeans can be used for active labeling. Instead of the\\nmodes the medoids are used. If the procedure is run for a number of times\\nusing diﬀerent values of k, a similar multi-level clustering is found as by MS.\\nThereby two diﬀerent classiﬁcation procedures are obtained, kMeans-AL for\\nactive learning based on the medoids of a single clustering and kMeans-ALC\\nif the set of clustering levels is combined.\\n\\nClusters found by the kMeans algorithm have a spherical shape. More-\\nover, all spheres have the same size. Consequently, the cluster medoids are,\\nwith some noise, uniformly distributed over the domain of the dataset. The\\n\\n9\\n\\n\\x0cMS procedure, on the other hand, ﬁnds clusters for which the shapes follow\\nthe shape of the density function around the density modes. In low density\\nareas the clusters are thereby wide, in high density areas they are narrow.\\n\\nA signiﬁcant diﬀerence between the two approaches is the computational\\neﬀort needed for ﬁnding a series of clusterings with diﬀerent numbers of\\nclusters. In MS this is performed in a single run, while kMeans needs for\\nevery cluster size a new call. Moreover, the time needed for such a call\\nis proportional with k, the desired number of clusters. This implies that\\nkMeans is bad for large numbers of clusters and good for small numbers.\\nBy comparing the numbers of distance computations needed for the two\\ncn for FMS (see Section 2.2) and (ηk + 1)n for kMeans,\\nprocedures, 2n\\nn kMeans has a larger computational\\nsee above, it shows that for k >\\ncomplexity in case a single clustering with k clusters has to be performed.\\nIn this reasoning we neglected the inﬂuence of the complexity parameter c\\nof FMS and the number of iterations η used in of kMeans.\\n\\n√\\n\\n√\\n\\nIn case classiﬁcation conﬁdences are to be found, multiple clustering are\\nneeded, some with a high number of clusters. For such applications the time\\ncomplexity of the kMeans procedure will be soon much larger than of FMS.\\n\\n3.5 Creating a nested set of multi-level clusterings\\n\\nFor an arbitrary multi-level set of clusterings C with Ni clusters of clustering\\nCi it is not guaranteed that the levels are nested. They are nested if all\\nobjects in a high-resolution cluster Chj belong to the same low-resolution\\ncluster C(cid:96)k with Nh > N(cid:96). Nested clusterings can be better interpreted. E.g.\\nagglomerative clusterings are automatically nested and can be inspected by\\na dendrogram.\\n\\nThere is an easy top-down procedure to make a given multi-level clus-\\ntering nested if the clusters are represented by prototypes, like the modal\\nobjects in this paper. The following steps are used to change a given low-\\nresolution clustering C(cid:96) into a modiﬁed clustering C (cid:48)\\n(cid:96) which is consistent with\\na high-resolution clustering Ch.\\n\\n1. All objects of all clusters in Ch for which the cluster prototypes belong\\n\\nto the same cluster C(cid:96)j are assigned to the same cluster in C (cid:48)\\n\\n(cid:96)j.\\n\\n2. If the prototype of C(cid:96)j is a member of C (cid:48)\\n\\n(cid:96)j it becomes the prototype of\\n\\nC (cid:48)\\n\\n(cid:96)j as well.\\n\\n3. If the prototype of C(cid:96)j is not a member of C (cid:48)\\n\\n(cid:96)j the prototype of the\\n\\nlargest constituting cluster in Ch becomes the prototype of C (cid:48)\\n\\n(cid:96)j.\\n\\nIn our active learning experiments we extended kNN mode seeking and\\nkMeans with nesting. The resulting procedures are called MS-ALN, FMS-\\nALN and kMeans-ALN.\\n\\n10\\n\\n\\x0c4 Application to hand-written characters\\n\\nIn this section experiments will be presented with three related large datasets.\\nThey serve as an illustration of the possibilities of kNN mode seeking as well\\nas an evaluation of its performance for clustering and active learning. They\\nare selected on the basis of their size (70 000 - 1.5 million objects) in order\\nto show the speed of the algorithms for larger datasets.\\n\\n4.1 The datasets\\n\\nWe selected three large, real world character based datasets and represented\\nthem in the same way by their pixels, using the same classes. Additionally\\nwe combined the sets and enlarged the resulting set by including rotated\\ncopies of the characters. The tree basic sets are:\\n\\n• MNIST. This is the well-known public domain dataset of 70000 hand-\\nwritten digits in 10 about equally sized classes. Originally they have\\nthe same size of 28 × 28 pixels. We normalized them all to 8 × 8\\npixels using bilinear interpolation by which they can be represented in\\na 64-dimensional feature space. Feature vectors are normalized such\\nthat their elements sum to one. See Fig. 1 for an arbitrary subset,\\nshowing the originals as well as the normalized ones. For the purpose\\nof this ﬁgure only, all sizes and maximum intensities are made equal.\\nIn a leave-one-out 1NN experiment a classiﬁcation error of 0.025 was\\nfound for the original dataset and 0.020 for the normalized one.\\n\\n• Block Letters. These are 82 541 handwritten characters, labeled in\\n43 classes: letters, digits and some special symbols. The largest class\\ncontains 6 109 characters, the smallest one has just 21 characters. The\\nbounding boxes around the characters have diﬀerent sizes, ranging from\\n3 × 3 to 65 × 70 pixels. We normalized this dataset in the same way\\nas the MNIST digits, see Fig. 2 for examples. In a leave-one-out 1NN\\nexperiment a classiﬁcation error of 0.099 was found.\\n\\n• Cursive Letters. These are 213 623 handwritten characters, labeled\\nin 42 classes, letters, digits and some special symbols. The largest class\\ncontains 21 432 characters, the smallest one has 34 characters. The\\nbounding boxes around the characters have diﬀerent sizes, ranging from\\n2 × 2 to 375 × 318 pixels. We normalized this dataset in the same way\\nas the MNIST digits, see Fig. 3 for examples. In a leave-one-out 1NN\\nexperiment a classiﬁcation error of 0.260 was found.\\n\\nWe also combined the three datasets into a single one, called ALL, with\\n366 164 objects, having the same 43 classes as the Block Letters. In order to\\nchallenge the possibilities of the procedure even further this set is enlarged\\nby a factor 4 by adding rotated versions of all characters over π/2, π and\\n3π/2 radials. This dataset, named ALLR, has 1 464 656 objects, still with\\n\\n11\\n\\n\\x0cFigure 1: MNIST examples, originals and normalized to 8 × 8 pixels.\\n\\nFigure 2: Block Letters examples, originals and normalized to 8 × 8 pixels.\\n\\nFigure 3: Cursive Letters examples, originals and normalized to 8×8 pixels.\\n\\n12\\n\\n\\x0cDataset #classes #objects #features\\nMNIST\\nBlock\\nCursive\\nALL\\nALLR\\n\\n70 000\\n82 541\\n213 623\\n366 164\\n1 464 656\\n\\n10\\n43\\n42\\n43\\n43\\n\\n64\\n64\\n64\\n64\\n64\\n\\n1NN error\\n0.020\\n0.099\\n0.260\\n0.230\\n0.237\\n\\nTable 1: Summary of the datasets used in the experiments.\\n\\n43 classes and represented by 64 features.

The properties of the ﬁve\\ndatasets as used by us are summarized in Table 1.\\n\\n4.2 Clustering\\n\\nThe following procedures, extensively discussed in the sections 2 and 3 are\\nused in the experiments:\\n\\n• kMeans The kMeans algorithm as described in 3.4\\n• MS The original kNN mode seeking algorithm as described in 2.1\\n• FMS The fast kNN mode seeking algorithm as described in 2.2. FMS-\\n2, FMS-4 and FMS-6 stand for the variants with complexity param-\\neters 2, 4 and 6.\\n\\nIn the experiments with the MS procedures the set of neighborhood sizes\\n(K) was chosen such that K(i) = 1.21 × K(i − 1) with K(1) = 2 and\\nK(i) < n/10, ∀i. n is the number of objects in the dataset. Values in K\\nwere rounded to integer. For n = 100 000 the size of K is 43, and for n =\\n1.5 million (the size of ALLR) it is 57.\\n\\nFirst we used the largest dataset, ALLR, to verify the speedup that was\\nexpected for the FMS procedure. A complexity of c = 6 was used in the\\nconstruction of the Q-cells, see Section 2.2. Computing times for various\\nsubsets of the ALLR dataset are shown in Figure 4. Surprisingly it shows\\nthat the computing time is O(n1.4) while it was argued in Section 2.2 that\\nthe minimum would be O(n1.5). Our explanation is that smaller datasets\\nhave smaller P-cells and Q-cells, resulting in smaller matrices used in the\\ndistance computation. In our Matlab implementation this is less eﬃcient.\\nThe clustering of larger datasets can thereby be computed more eﬃciently.\\nIn order to study the inﬂuence of the complexity parameter of the FMS\\nalgorithm (see Section 2.2) it was run on the three smaller datasets, MNIST,\\nBlock and Cursive for c = 2, 4 and 6. Results are compared with MS and\\nkMeans. The latter was run for all numbers of clusters that were found by\\nMS. To save computing time of kMeans, at the cost of accuracy, optimization\\n\\n13\\n\\n\\x0cFigure 4: Computing time for FMS-6 as a function of the dataset size.\\nSubsets of the ALLR datasets were used.

First, the ﬁgures show that the fast pro-\\ncedures FMS-2, FMS-4 and FMS-6 ﬁnd for small neighborhood sizes about\\nthe same numbers of clusters as found by the slow original procedure MS.\\nFor k ≈ 20 the numbers slowly deviate: more clusters are found than by MS\\nmost likely due to the limited cell sizes by which some clusters cannot be\\nmerged. It can be clearly observed that the higher the complexity param-\\neter c the better the FMS-c curves approximate the MS ones. For k ≈ 70\\nclustering by FMS stops as this is about the size of the smallest cells.\\n\\n14\\n\\n\\x0cFigure 5: Numbers of clusters found for the three datasets by MS and FMS.\\nThe right ﬁgures are zoomed versions of the ones on the left.\\n\\n15\\n\\n\\x0cA second observation is that\\nthe average cluster sizes of the\\nthree datasets seem to be diﬀer-\\nent. In a combined graph based\\non the MS curves, Figure 6, this\\ncan be observed better. The\\nBlock Letter dataset has smaller\\nclusters than the Cursive Letters\\nas it has considerably less ob-\\njects and is thereby less dense.\\nThe even smaller MNIST Dig-\\nits dataset has, however, for k <\\n200 about the same cluster sizes\\nas Cursive Letters. This might\\nbe explained by the lower vari-\\nability of MNIST (just ten well\\ndeﬁned classes), see Figure 1.\\n\\nFigure 6: Averaged cluster sizes of\\nthe MS procedure for the three smaller\\ndatasets.\\n\\n4.3 Cluster evaluation by the mutual information with\\n\\ntrue labels\\n\\nThe purpose of clustering is to ﬁnd meaningful subsets in the data. Whether\\nclusters are meaningful is application dependent, but very often it implies\\nthat they should make sense for human judgement.\\nIn this paper we are\\nthereby using labeled datasets and verify to what extend the obtained clusters\\ncorrespond with the human class labeling. The measure we use is the below\\ndeﬁned Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) between the cluster labels ηi\\nand the class labels λj (note that the number of classes is usually diﬀerent\\nfrom the number of clusters)\\n\\nI(η, λ) =\\n\\np(ηi, λj) log\\n\\n(cid:88)\\n\\n(cid:88)\\n\\n(cid:26)\\n\\n∀i\\n\\n∀j\\n\\n(cid:19)(cid:27)\\n\\n(cid:18) p(ηi, λj)\\np(ηi)p(λj)\\n\\nwhich is the mutual information. It is normalized to obtain values between\\n0 and 1:\\n\\nIn(η, λ) =\\n\\nI(η, λ)\\nmin{H(η), H(λ}\\n\\nin which H(x) = − (cid:80)\\n∀x{p(x) log p(x)} is the entropy of a discrete random\\nvariable x. The values of NMI (6) between the true class labels and the\\nMS and FMS clusterings of three datasets is shown in Figure 7. For large\\nnumbers of clusters the value of NMI approximates one as small clusters\\ntend to have objects of a single class. kMeans performs similar and often\\n\\n(5)\\n\\n(6)\\n\\n16\\n\\n\\x0cFigure 7: Clustering evaluation for three datasets based on the Normalized\\nMutual Information (NMI) as deﬁned by (6).

For larger complexities\\nc results for the proposed FMS-c are almost similar to those of the much\\nslower original MS algorithm.\\n\\nIn Figure 8 the evaluation\\ncurves of the ﬁve datasets are\\nshown together. They all grow\\nasymptotically to NMI = 1,\\nwhich is obviously the case if\\nthe number of clusters equals the\\nsize of the dataset. If every ob-\\nject is in a separate cluster the\\nmutual information between the\\nobject labels and the clustering\\nis one. The MNIST results are\\nbetter as there are just 10 in-\\nstead of 43 classes and because\\nthese classes are better separa-\\nble. Moreover, in general holds\\nthat the larger the dataset the\\nlower the curves. See Table 1 for\\ndataset sizes.\\n\\nFigure 8: Clustering evaluation by the\\nNormalized Mutual Information (NMI)\\nfor all datasets based on FMS-6.\\n\\n4.4 Cluster evaluation by active learning\\n\\nAn important application of clustering of large datasets is active learning:\\nrepresentative objects to be labeled are found by the structure in the data. In\\nthe next step these objects may be used for training a classiﬁer. Alternatively\\nthe clusters can be used to label the unlabeled objects by the labeled objects\\nin the same cluster. In our experiments the modal objects obtained by MS\\nor FMS or the medoid objects determined in the kMeans clusters are used\\nfor labeling the other objects in the same cluster.\\n\\nIn Figure 9 learning curves are presented for the three clustering proce-\\ndures, kMeans, MS and FMS-6. They are compared with two LDA classiﬁers\\nand the 1NN rule:\\n\\n• MS-LDA, using the modal objects of the clusters, after retrieving their\\n\\n• Random-LDA, using a randomly generated training set, repeated 10\\n\\n• Random-1NN, using a randomly generated training set, repeated 10\\n\\nlabels, for training.\\n\\ntimes and averaged.\\n\\ntimes and averaged.\\n\\nThese curves are based on single experiments and look noisy.

The right ﬁgures are zoomed versions\\nof the ones on the left.\\n\\n19\\n\\n\\x0cnot help. Nevertheless, it is clear that the clustering based classiﬁcations are\\nsigniﬁcantly better than those obtained by the LDA and 1NN. This can be\\nexpected as these classiﬁers depend on the selected objects only, while the\\nclustering based classiﬁcations use the entire data structure. An advantage\\nof training a classiﬁer, however, is that it can be used for future objects\\nwhile the clustering based classiﬁcation is only applicable to the objects that\\nparticipated in the clustering.\\n\\nThere is a distinction between the two LDA classiﬁers, suggesting that\\nusing a clustering scheme for selecting a training set for a classiﬁer is better\\nthan using a randomly selected training set.\\n\\nAs was observed for the mutual\\ninformation in Section 4.3,\\nit ap-\\npears that also for active learning\\nthe fast algorithm FMS-c approxi-\\nmates the performance of the orig-\\ninal procedure MS for larger com-\\nplexities, see Figure 9. The results\\nof the maximum complexity c = 6\\nstudied here are close to the re-\\nsults of MS, but their computation is\\nsome orders of magnitude faster, see\\nSection 4.2 and Table 2. In Figure 10\\nthe learning curves of FMS-6 based\\non the classiﬁcation error are sum-\\nmarized for all datasets. The rela-\\ntive behavior is similar to the mutual\\ninformation curves in Figure 8.\\n\\nFigure 10: Active Learning evalua-\\ntion based on FMS-AL compared for\\nall datasets.\\n\\nThe kMeans procedure is sometimes better, sometimes worse than the MS\\nbased procedures. However, the computation of learning curves, as presented\\nhere, is highly computational intensive for kMeans, as it has to be repeated\\nfor all values of k. The mode seeking clustering MS needs just a single run and\\ncan be well approximated by the fast FMS algorithm, see Table 2. Recall that\\nthe number of distance computations needed for FMS is O(n(cid:112)(n)), while it\\nis for kMeans O(nkη) with η the number of iterations used per update. As\\nwe have bounded the computing time per iteration to 10s it appeared that\\nfor small values of nk hundreds of iterations could be used, while for large\\nvalues (for our data about nk > 2 × 108) just one update could be possible.\\nThis may have deteriorated the results of kMeans.\\n\\nNext we studied the active learning classiﬁcation results of combining all\\nclustering levels as proposed in Section 3.2. In Figure 11 the original learning\\ncurves of MS-AL are compared with the combined classiﬁers, FMS-ALC, and\\nand with nesting, FMS-ALN. It shows that signiﬁcant improvements could\\nbe reached. The FMS-ALC procedure, however, is slow as for all objects the\\n\\n20\\n\\n\\x0cconﬁdences have to be propagated and averaged over the clustering levels.\\nNesting is fast as it is based on changing cluster indices only.\\n\\nFigure 11: Active Learning evaluation comparing active learning classiﬁ-\\ncation results based on a single clustering level, FMS-AL, with the combining\\nthe cluster level classiﬁcations, FMS-ALC, and with nesting, FMS-ALN.\\n\\n4.5 Reject curves\\n\\nThe FMS-ALC and kMeans-ALC classiﬁers yield conﬁdences that may be\\nused for studying reject curves. As an example we considered cases of about\\n1000 clusters found by FMS, thereby generating training sets of bout 1000\\nobjects. All other objects were classiﬁed and results with conﬁdences lower\\nthan some threshold were rejected. The classiﬁcation performances of the\\nremaining objects (with high classiﬁcation conﬁdences) as a function of the\\nrejects rate are shown in Figure 12.\\n\\nThe kMeans-ALC classiﬁer shows better results. Its reject curve for the\\nMNIST dataset is really good. It starts with rejecting just erroneously classi-\\nﬁed objects as for low rejects rates the error curve drops as fast as the reject\\nrate goes up.\\n\\n21\\n\\n\\x0cFigure 12: Reject curves for the three datasets based on slightly more than\\n1000 labeled objects and conﬁdences computed by FMS-ALC.\\n\\n5 Conclusions\\n\\nThe main results of our study are:\\n\\n• We found a feasible way to ﬁnd density information of datasets of mil-\\nlions of objects in high-dimensional spaces. This information is ex-\\npressed in modal objects and pointers to them for every object in the\\ndataset.\\n\\n• The obtained density information is multi-scale as it is based on several\\n\\nneighborhood sizes simultaneously.\\n\\n• The modal objects can be used to obtain a multi-level clustering, pos-\\n\\nsible thousands of clusters in millions of objects.\\n\\n• By labeling the modal objects a good active learning classiﬁer is con-\\nstructed that is better than classiﬁers trained by randomly selected\\nsubsets of the dataset.\\n\\n• By combining the classiﬁcation results of various clustering levels, clas-\\n\\nsiﬁcation conﬁdences resulting in better classiﬁers are obtained.\\n\\n• The time-complexity of the procedure is O(n\\n\\nn) resulting in seconds\\n\\n√\\n\\nfor 104 objects to less than an hour for 106 objects.\\n\\n22\\n\\n\\x0cAcknowledgments\\n\\nThe authors thank Marco Loog, David Tax, Marcel Reinders and the mem-\\nbers of the Delft Pattern Recognition Laboratory for support and hospitality.\\nPrime Vision is acknowledged for supplying the datasets Block Letters and\\nCursive Letters.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\n[1] Comaniciu, D., Meer, P.: Mean shift: A robust approach toward feature space\\n\\nanalysis.

       "'a signiﬁcantly faster algorithm is presented for the original knn mode seeking procedure. it has the advantages over the well known mean shift algorithm that it is feasible in high dimensional vector spaces and results in uniquely well deﬁned modes. moreover without any additional computational eﬀort it may yield a multi scale hierarchy of clusterings. the time complexity is just o. resulting computing times range from seconds for objects to minutes for objects and to less than an hour for objects. the space complexity is just o. the procedure is well suited for ﬁnding large sets of small clusters and is thereby a candidate to analyze thousands of clusters in millions of objects. the knn mode seeking procedure can be used for active learning by assigning the clusters to the class of the modal objects of the clusters. its feasibility is shown by some examples with up to . million handwritten digits. the obtained classiﬁcation results based on the clusterings are compared with those obtained by the nearest neighbor rule and the support vector classiﬁer based on the same labeled objects for training. it can be concluded that using the clustering structure for classiﬁcation can be signiﬁcantly better than using the trained classiﬁers. a drawback of using the clustering for classiﬁcation however is that no classiﬁer is obtained that may be used for out of sample objects. introduction mode seeking clustering is based on ﬁnding the modes of the estimated probability density function of a given set of objects. for every mode a cluster is deﬁned consisting of all objects for which the density gradient followed from that object arrives at the particular mode. the basic idea can be traced back to two papers by fukunaga et al. in the seventies. in order to be able to handle arbitrarily shaped clusters non parametric density estimates are needed. fukunaga et al. considered the two well known ways parzen kernel densities as well as estimates based on the k nearest neighbors . the kernel density estimate has been studied extensively for mode seeking clustering. it has been made most popular by the mean shift algorithm . this is based on gradient estimates computed from the derivative of the kernel function. for higher dimensionalities iteratively computing and following the gradient is a computationally intensive procedure. moreover the number of restarts that is needed is a multiple of the number of modes. a randomly selected subset of objects is used for starting the gradient searches. the mean shift procedure is particulary useful for low dimensional datasets with a small or moderate number of clusters. an additional problem to be solved is the selection of the kernel. a small one will result in many clusters a large one will combine them and may yield a too smooth result. in practise this may be solved by running the entire procedure for a set of kernels. the knn mode seeking clustering as described in is simpler faster but less accurate than the original proposal by koontz and fukunaga . densities are not exactly computed but are just related to the distance to the k th nearest neighbor. the smaller k the higher the clustering resolution and the more modes are found. gradient steps are deﬁned by setting and following pointers from every object to the one with the highest density in its neighborhood which we will call the modal object . consequently after computing all n n distances between the n objects in a dataset all modes can be found by following the pointers from all objects. the computational eﬀort is negligible compared to the distance computations of the previous step. in it is discussed how to avoid the storage of all distances. a big advantage of the proposal is that diﬀerent clustering resolutions related to a set of neighborhood sizes k can be simultaneously computed without the need of any recomputation. this can be achieved by just the cost of storing multiple pointers which is feasible as the full distance matrix is not stored. the total space complexity is o in which d is the number of features and m is the number of neighborhood sizes. from the application point of view knn mode seeking has the advantage the concept of modal objects has been used in a diﬀerent way outside statistical data analysis in the ﬁeld of natural languages by f. moltmann see a predicativist semantics of modals based on modal objects proc. of the amsterdam colloquium . over the mean shift algorithm that an automatic scaling is included in a k nearest neighbor approach. objects in less dense areas will be related to more distant objects than in high density regions. in the mean shift algorithm kernels have the same shape over the entire vector space. in this paper a fast procedure for knn mode seeking is presented evalin section the fast uated and applied to the labeling of large datasets. algorithm is discussed and it is shown that it approximates the same clusn instead of all n n distances. this is tering by computing just n achieved by constructing a set of overlapping cells by which for every object the number of candidates that might belong to the k nearest neighbors is signiﬁcantly reduced. whether this approximation is appropriate depends on the structure of the data and the type of clusters to be searched and thereby on the application. in section various possibilities of the labeling of a large dataset are considered based on mode seeking clustering. by using the labels of just the modal objects the clustering can be used for labeling all other objects resulting in an active labeling procedure. this classiﬁcation scheme can be improved by using the multi level clustering property of the knn mode seeking procedure that is obtained by almost no additional computational eﬀort. the same structure can be used for including a reject option. the proposed procedures are illustrated and evaluated is section by some of large datasets of handwritten characters ranging from objects to almost million objects. computing times cluster qualities and classiﬁcation performances as a function of the number of labeled objects are measured and graphically shown. conclusions are summarized in the ﬁnal section . the software and some dataset used in this paper are publicly available . fast knn mode seeking algorithm . the original knn mode seeking algorithm in the version of knn mode seeking as described in object densities are deﬁned as the reverse of the distance to the k th nearest neighbor. the below algorithm is used. it is good for very large datasets with n objects. all pairwise distances are needed two times. as n distances cannot be stored they are computed twice. this is done for a set of m neighborhood sizes k in parallel by which nm densities and nm pointers have to be stored. these are used to compute nm cluster indices for m diﬀerent clustering resolutions of the n objects. . s is the user

stored for all objects. the neighborhoods themselves are not stored in this algorithm. they are recomputed in the next loop in order to ﬁnd for every neighborhood size k the objects with the highest densities. the pointers to objects with higher densities are for all resolutions followed in the iteration loop . this ﬁnal loop takes almost no time in comparison with the two other ones. in case the studied neighborhood sizes are small e.g. up to the indices of the neighborhood objects can be stored in the ﬁrst loop. for that case the computing time of the second loop becomes negligible too. as we are interested in larger neighborhood sizes this does not hold for the experiments described in section . the time complexity of this algorithm is at least o as in the ﬁrst loop the distances of all objects to all other ones have to be computed. as they are not stored no use of symmetry can be made. various proposals have been made to speed up the computation of the nearest neighbors e.g. by the use of k d trees. they are especially eﬀective in low dimensional spaces and for an determination of the ﬁrst nearest neighbor. they do not oﬀer a solution for ﬁnding the neighbors in a large neighborhood which is needed to ﬁnd larger clusters. in the remainder of this paper we will refer to this original knn mode seeking algorithm by ms. . the proposed fast knn mode seeking algorithm the original algorithm presented in section . is slow for very large datasets due to its time complexity. every object is compared with every other object. for measuring densities however it is suﬃcient to relate objects just with their neighboring ones. if candidate neighborhood objects could be selected without inspecting them all a speedup would be realized. in a procedure is presented which experimentally appeared to have a time complexity of o. this procedure however is based on a ﬁxed neighborhood size while the advantage of our procedure is that it can handle simultaneously a set of neighborhood sizes. inspired by the result of we developed the following procedure. first a small set p of m n objects is selected e.g. at random. it is not essential that p is a subset of the given dataset s but its feature representation should be in the same domain as s. next the nearest neighbor graph is computed in which every object in s points to its nearest neighbor in p. in this way s is split into m subsets and the space is split into m cells. for this operation nm distance computations are needed. cells contain on the average n m objects but may have diﬀerent sizes. we name this set of non overlapping cells the p cells. for suﬃciently small values of k it is expected that the k nearest neighbors of an object are in the same cell. consequently just n instead of n distances need to be computed in addition to ﬁnd for every object in s its k nearest neighbors. in total this demands thereby at least nm n distance computations . this is n is chosen. the total number of distances that has to minimum if m be computed is thereby at least n n. in every p cell some objects may be close to the cell border and it might thereby happen that some of their k nearest neighbors in the total dataset s are in a neighboring cell and are thereby not considered. in order to reduce the probability that this happens we enlarged the set of candidates deﬁned by all objects that share the same object in p as their nearest neighbor in p and change it to all objects that share the same object in p as belonging to their set of c nearest neighbors. this results in a set of overlapping cells to be called q cells that contain in the order of cn m objects. for every p cell there is a larger q cell that entirely contains the p cell. the neighborhood search in the fast mode seeking procedure will for every object be restricted to the objects in the q cell deﬁned by the pif all q cells would contain exactly this cell to which the object belongs. number of objects the number of distance computations is now minimum cn distance computations. so the for m n . the speed up of the fast time complexity of the fast algorithm is o n algorithm is thereby in the order of n c. cn resulting in at least n a formal description of the algorithm is given below. it follows the same three loops as the algorithm in section .. the ﬁrst two loops however are now restricted to the objects in the q cells instead of all objects. the p set is chosen at random from the available dataset s. . s is the user supplied set of objects with size n. . c is the user deﬁned complexity parameter. . k is a user deﬁned set of target neighborhood sizes k . . select at random a subset p of m . determine for every object in s its c nearest neighbors in p. . construct a set of m p cells of objects in s that have the same object cn objects out of s. in p as their nearest neighbor in p. . construct a set of m q cells of objects in s that share the same object in p in their c nearest neighbors in p. i sik. sort them si sortj store density estimates k k f k . repeat for all n objects xi in s . determine the p cell pi to which xi belongs. . determine the q cell qi to which pi belongs. . compute all distances dij of xi to all objects xj in qi. . . . next i . repeat for all n objects xi in s . determine the p cell pi to which xi belongs. . determine the q cell qi to which pi belongs. . compute all distances dij of xi to all objects xj in qi. . rank them ti argsortj qi store for all k k a pointer uk . . next i . repeat for all sizes k k . repeat until no change i uk . . next k store clustering for neighborhood size k ck our implementation is for the selection of the subset p slightly more complicated. a fully random choice may result is some very small p cells. this may result in a bad quality of the knn search. for that reason we remove the few p cells that contain less than n objects. in section some real world examples are given comparing the fast algorithm with the original one. in the remainder of this paper we will refer to the fast knn mode seeking by fms or fms c in which c is the value of the complexity parameter. by default c . classifying objects based on knn mode seek ing clustering in this section some ways are described to use knn mode seeking clustering for the classiﬁcation of a large set of unlabeled objects using a small set of labeled ones. the clustering procedure is applied to the entire dataset. in case the objects to be labeled are determined by the clustering this results in active learning. . knn mode seeking applied to active learning an important application of knn mode seeking is based on the property that clusters are represented by a single object the modal object. this is the object with the highest estimated density in the corresponding cluster. all other objects in the cluster have a pointer to this one. consequently a fast way of labeling the entire dataset is achieved by labeling the modal objects by a human expert followed by assigning all objects to the class of the modal object of their cluster. this may reduce the cost of labeling considerably. moreover it is expected that the modal objects represent the dataset well. thereby the obtained classiﬁcation may be more accurate than a classiﬁer trained by a randomly selected training set of the same size. the following procedure is used . perform ms or fms clustering on the entire dataset using a set of values for k e.g. k resulting in diﬀerent clusterings ci i . . . . . determine the number of clusters ni for every clustering ci. . select an appropriate clustering ci w.r.t. the permissable cost of labeling the ni modal objects found for clustering ci i . . . . . label the ni modal objects of clustering ci . . assign for every cluster in clustering ci all objects to the class of their modal object. this can be considered as a way of active learning. therefore we name the procedure ms al or fms al. there are however some diﬀerences with the traditional active learning procedures as the above algorithm is a onestep procedure. there is no intermediate or ﬁnal classiﬁer computed that is used to select additional objects to be labeled. it seems thereby to be most appropriate for labeling a given dataset as all objects to be labeled are used for estimating the density of these objects. there is no prediction of densities of future not yet seen objects. in the above algorithm several clusterings are found but just a single one is used the one with an appropriate number of clusters. one may wonder whether the other available clusterings cannot be used for improving the classiﬁcation. in the next subsections some possibilities are discussed. . knn mode seeking combined with multi level conﬁdence based classiﬁcation in the active learning classiﬁcation procedure as deﬁned above all objects within a cluster receive the same class assignments. the rationale behind it is that a cluster is expected to contain similar objects. in case more objects in a cluster have known labels or class conﬁdences q assigning a cluster average of class conﬁdences to all objects in the cluster follows the same idea qij cij xt cij q here qij is an estimated row vector of class conﬁdences based on cluster cij being cluster j of clustering i. let qi be the n r matrix of the class conﬁdences for the r classes of all n objects and let ai be an n n matrix with ai t t cij if xt cij xt cij otherwise we ranked the clusterings from low resolution to high resolution clusterings. the conﬁdences qi are estimated from the conﬁdences qi of clustering level i with less clusters by averaging the conﬁdences of level i according to the clustering of level i qi ai qi by iterating over all clustering levels conﬁdence estimates can be obtained for all of them from an initial estimate. this can be obtained from the ﬁrst level q by active learning. on this level for every cluster the modal object is selected and labeled. all objects in a cluster are given the same conﬁdence one for the class of the label and zero for all other classes. the described procedure of propagating and averaging conﬁdences is consistent with the active learning procedure in which all objects receive the same class as the modal object. as on higher clustering levels some clusters may contain objects of diﬀerent lower resolution clusters the object conﬁdences may receive contributions of various classes. several alternative updating schemes may be possible for a given a set of clusterings. in playing around with one of the datasets discussed in section the above procedure has been chosen for combining multi level clusterings based on fms or ms for active learning. we name it fms alc or ms alc if based on the ms clustering. the matrix a is large but sparse. in our implementation computations are made cluster by cluster avoiding the need to store a. . reject curves for knn mode seeking classiﬁcation as the active learning classiﬁers ms alc and fms alc output conﬁdences they may be used for rejecting objects with a low conﬁdence of the selected class . in section some examples will be shown. in a sequential active learning scheme objects with a low classiﬁcation conﬁdence might be good candidates for additional labeling. . use of kmeans as a baseline procedure a good candidate for a comparative study of the properties of the proposed fms is the classical kmeans procedure . it iteratively ﬁnds a preset number of clusters k by updating cluster means. in order to obtain modal objects to label the clusters the cluster procedure should be extended e.g. by the computation of cluster medoid objects in the clusters that are most close to the cluster means see . in our implementation medoid objects are just used for labeling the clustering is not changed. the total number of distance computations is n if the algorithm runs for η iterations. for large datasets η can be large before stability is reached. in practice the algorithm can be stopped prematurely obtaining an approximate clustering. note that the parameter k has a diﬀerent meaning in the two algorithms kmeans and knn mode seeking. in mode seeking k determines the size of the neighborhood used for setting pointers to objects with a higher density. by following the pointers the total number of modes in the entire dataset may be considerably smaller than n k. the kmeans algorithm on the other hand will result in k clusters . like ms or fms kmeans can be used for active labeling. instead of the modes the medoids are used. if the procedure is run for a number of times using diﬀerent values of k a similar multi level clustering is found as by ms. thereby two diﬀerent classiﬁcation procedures are obtained kmeans al for active learning based on the medoids of a single clustering and kmeans alc if the set of clustering levels is combined. clusters found by the kmeans algorithm have a spherical shape. moreover all spheres have the same size. consequently the cluster medoids are with some noise uniformly distributed over the domain of the dataset. the ms procedure on the other hand ﬁnds clusters for which the shapes follow the shape of the density function around the density modes. in low density areas the clusters are thereby wide in high density areas they are narrow. a signiﬁcant diﬀerence between the two approaches is the computational eﬀort needed for ﬁnding a series of clusterings with diﬀerent numbers of clusters. in ms this is performed in a single run while kmeans needs for every cluster size a new call. moreover the time needed for such a call is proportional with k the desired number of clusters. this implies that kmeans is bad for large numbers of clusters and good for small numbers. by comparing the numbers of distance computations needed for the two cn for fms and n for kmeans procedures n n kmeans has a larger computational see above it shows that for k complexity in case a single clustering with k clusters has to be performed. in this reasoning we neglected the inﬂuence of the complexity parameter c of fms and the number of iterations η used in of kmeans. in case classiﬁcation conﬁdences are to be found multiple clustering are needed some with a high number of clusters. for such applications the time complexity of the kmeans procedure will be soon much larger than of fms. . creating a nested set of multi level clusterings for an arbitrary multi level set of clusterings c with ni clusters of clustering ci it is not guaranteed that the levels are nested. they are nested if all objects in a high resolution cluster chj belong to the same low resolution cluster ck with nh n. nested clusterings can be better interpreted. e.g. agglomerative clusterings are automatically nested and can be inspected by a dendrogram. there is an easy top down procedure to make a given multi level clustering nested if the clusters are represented by prototypes like the modal objects in this paper. the following steps are used to change a given lowresolution clustering c into a modiﬁed clustering c which is consistent with a high resolution clustering ch. . all objects of all clusters in ch for which the cluster prototypes belong to the same cluster cj are assigned to the same cluster in c j. . if the prototype of cj is a member of c j it becomes the prototype of c j as well. . if the prototype of cj is not a member of c j the prototype of the largest constituting cluster in ch becomes the prototype of c j. in our active learning experiments we extended knn mode seeking and kmeans with nesting. the resulting procedures are called ms aln fmsaln and kmeans aln. application to hand written characters in this section experiments will be presented with three related large datasets. they serve as an illustration of the possibilities of knn mode seeking as well as an evaluation of its performance for clustering and active learning. they are selected on the basis of their size in order to show the speed of the algorithms for larger datasets. . the datasets we selected three large real world character based datasets and represented them in the same way by their pixels using the same classes. additionally we combined the sets and enlarged the resulting set by including rotated copies of the characters. the tree basic sets are mnist. this is the well known public domain dataset of handwritten digits in about equally sized classes. originally they have the same size of pixels. we normalized them all to pixels using bilinear interpolation by which they can be represented in a dimensional feature space. feature vectors are normalized such that their elements sum to one. see fig. for an arbitrary subset showing the originals as well as the normalized ones. for the purpose of this ﬁgure only all sizes and maximum intensities are made equal. in a leave one out nn experiment a classiﬁcation error of . was found for the original dataset and . for the normalized one. block letters. these are handwritten characters labeled in classes letters digits and some special symbols. the largest class contains characters the smallest one has just characters. the bounding boxes around the characters have diﬀerent sizes ranging from to pixels. we normalized this dataset in the same way as the mnist digits see fig. for examples. in a leave one out nn experiment a classiﬁcation error of . was found. cursive letters. these are handwritten characters labeled in classes letters digits and some special symbols. the largest class contains characters the smallest one has characters. the bounding boxes around the characters have diﬀerent sizes ranging from to pixels. we normalized this dataset in the same way as the mnist digits see fig. for examples. in a leave one out nn experiment a classiﬁcation error of . was found. we also combined the three datasets into a single one called all with objects having the same classes as the block letters. in order to challenge the possibilities of the procedure even further this set is enlarged by a factor by adding rotated versions of all characters over π π and π radials. this dataset named allr has objects still with figure mnist examples originals and normalized to pixels. figure block letters examples

of the datasets used in the experiments. classes and represented by features. the estimated leave one out nn errors of these two datasets are . and .. the properties of the ﬁve datasets as used by us are summarized in table . . clustering the following procedures extensively discussed in the sections and are used in the experiments kmeans the kmeans algorithm as described in . ms the original knn mode seeking algorithm as described in . fms the fast knn mode seeking algorithm as described in .. fms fms and fms stand for the variants with complexity parameters and . in the experiments with the ms procedures the set of neighborhood sizes was chosen such that k . k with k and k n i. n is the number of objects in the dataset. values in k were rounded to integer. for n the size of k is and for n . million it is . first we used the largest dataset allr to verify the speedup that was expected for the fms procedure. a complexity of c was used in the construction of the q cells see section .. computing times for various subsets of the allr dataset are shown in figure . surprisingly it shows that the computing time is o while it was argued in section . that the minimum would be o. our explanation is that smaller datasets have smaller p cells and q cells resulting in smaller matrices used in the distance computation. in our matlab implementation this is less eﬃcient. the clustering of larger datasets can thereby be computed more eﬃciently. in order to study the inﬂuence of the complexity parameter of the fms algorithm it was run on the three smaller datasets mnist block and cursive for c and . results are compared with ms and kmeans. the latter was run for all numbers of clusters that were found by ms. to save computing time of kmeans at the cost of accuracy optimization figure computing time for fms as a function of the dataset size. subsets of the allr datasets were used. the ﬁgure shows that the time complexity is o. iterations have been limited to s for every

. . . table computing times in seconds for a set of multi level clusterings see also figure . in figure the numbers of clusters found by ms and fms are shown as a function of the neighborhood parameter k for the three smaller datasets. two observations may be of interest. first the ﬁgures show that the fast procedures fms fms and fms ﬁnd for small neighborhood sizes about the same numbers of clusters as found by the slow original procedure ms. for k the numbers slowly deviate more clusters are found than by ms most likely due to the limited cell sizes by which some clusters cannot be merged. it can be clearly observed that the higher the complexity parameter c the better the fms c curves approximate the ms ones. for k clustering by fms stops as this is about the size of the smallest cells. figure numbers of clusters found for the three datasets by ms and fms. the right ﬁgures are zoomed versions of the ones on the left. a second observation is that the average cluster sizes of the three datasets seem to be diﬀerent. in a combined graph based on the ms curves figure this can be observed better. the block letter dataset has smaller clusters than the cursive letters as it has considerably less objects and is thereby less dense. the even smaller mnist digits dataset has however for k about the same cluster sizes as cursive letters. this might be explained by the lower variability of mnist see figure . figure averaged cluster sizes of the ms procedure for the three smaller datasets. . cluster evaluation by the mutual information with true labels the purpose of clustering is to ﬁnd meaningful subsets in the data. whether clusters are meaningful is application dependent but very often it implies that they should make sense for human judgement. in this paper we are thereby using labeled datasets and verify to what extend the obtained clusters correspond with the human class labeling. the measure we use is the below deﬁned normalized mutual information between the cluster labels ηi and the class labels λj i p log i j p pp which is the mutual information. it is normalized to obtain values between and in i min in which h x is the entropy of a discrete random variable x. the values of nmi between the true class labels and the ms and fms clusterings of three datasets is shown in figure . for large numbers of clusters the value of nmi approximates one as small clusters tend to have objects of a single class. kmeans performs similar and often figure clustering evaluation for three datasets based on the normalized mutual information as deﬁned by . the right ﬁgures are zoomed versions of the ones on the left. even better than ms on the basis of this criterion. for larger complexities c results for the proposed fms c are almost similar to those of the much slower original ms algorithm. in figure the evaluation curves of the ﬁve datasets are shown together. they all grow asymptotically to nmi which is obviously the case if the number of clusters equals the size of the dataset. if every object is in a separate cluster the mutual information between the object labels and the clustering is one. the mnist results are better as there are just instead of classes and because these classes are better separable. moreover in general holds that the larger the dataset the lower the curves. see table for dataset sizes. figure clustering evaluation by the normalized mutual information for all datasets based on fms . . cluster evaluation by active learning an important application of clustering of large datasets is active learning representative objects to be labeled are found by the structure in the data. in the next step these objects may be used for training a classiﬁer. alternatively the clusters can be used to label the unlabeled objects by the labeled objects in the same cluster. in our experiments the modal objects obtained by ms or fms or the medoid objects determined in the kmeans clusters are used for labeling the other objects in the same cluster. in figure learning curves are presented for the three clustering procedures kmeans ms and fms . they are compared with two lda classiﬁers and the nn rule ms lda using the modal objects of the clusters after retrieving their random lda using a randomly generated training set repeated random nn using a randomly generated training set repeated labels for training. times and averaged. times and averaged. these curves are based on single experiments and look noisy. a number of them those based on ms are deterministic as they are not dependent on a randomly selected subset of objects. so repeating and averaging will figure active learning evaluation for three datasets. ms lda is the lda classiﬁer trained by the modal objects of the clusters. random lda and random nn are trained by a randomly selected training set with the size of the number of clusters on the x axis. the right ﬁgures are zoomed versions of the ones on the left. not help. nevertheless it is clear that the clustering based classiﬁcations are signiﬁcantly better than those obtained by the lda and nn. this can be expected as these classiﬁers depend on the selected objects only while the clustering based classiﬁcations use the entire data structure. an advantage of training a classiﬁer however is that it can be used for future objects while the clustering based classiﬁcation is only applicable to the objects that participated in the clustering. there is a distinction between the two lda classiﬁers suggesting that using a clustering scheme for selecting a training set for a classiﬁer is better than using a randomly selected training set. as was observed for the mutual information in section . it appears that also for active learning the fast algorithm fms c approximates the performance of the original procedure ms for larger complexities see figure . the results of the maximum complexity c studied here are close to the results of ms but their computation is some orders of magnitude faster see section . and table . in figure the learning curves of fms based on the classiﬁcation error are summarized for all datasets. the relative behavior is similar to the mutual information curves in figure . figure active learning evaluation based on fms al compared for all datasets. the kmeans procedure is sometimes better sometimes worse than the ms based procedures. however the computation of learning curves as presented here is highly computational intensive for kmeans as it has to be repeated for all values of k. the mode seeking clustering ms needs just a single run and can be well approximated by the fast fms algorithm see table . recall that the number of distance computations needed for fms is o while it is for kmeans o with η the number of iterations used per update. as we have bounded the computing time per iteration to s it appeared that for small values of nk hundreds of iterations could be used while for large values just one update could be possible. this may have deteriorated the results of kmeans. next we studied the active learning classiﬁcation results of combining all clustering levels as proposed in section .. in figure the original learning curves of ms al are compared with the combined classiﬁers fms alc and and with nesting fms aln. it shows that signiﬁcant improvements could be reached. the fms alc procedure however is slow as for all objects the conﬁdences have to be propagated and averaged over the clustering levels. nesting is fast as it is based on changing cluster indices only. figure active learning evaluation comparing active learning classiﬁcation results based on a single clustering level fms al with the combining the cluster level classiﬁcations fms alc and with nesting fms aln. . reject curves the fms alc and kmeans alc classiﬁers yield conﬁdences that may be used for studying reject curves. as an example we considered cases of about clusters found by fms thereby generating training sets of bout objects. all other objects were classiﬁed and results with conﬁdences lower than some threshold were rejected. the classiﬁcation performances of the remaining objects as a function of the rejects rate are shown in figure . the kmeans alc classiﬁer shows better results. its reject curve for the mnist dataset is really good. it starts with rejecting just erroneously classiﬁed objects as for low rejects rates the error curve drops as fast as the reject rate goes up. figure reject curves for the three datasets based on slightly more than labeled objects and conﬁdences computed by fms alc. conclusions the main results of our study are we found a feasible way to ﬁnd density information of datasets of millions of objects in high dimensional spaces. this information is expressed in modal objects and pointers to them for every object in the dataset. the obtained density information is multi scale as it is based on several neighborhood sizes simultaneously. the modal objects can be used to obtain a multi level clustering pos sible thousands of clusters in millions of objects. by labeling the modal objects a good active learning classiﬁer is constructed that is better than classiﬁers trained by randomly selected subsets of the dataset. by combining the classiﬁcation results of various clustering levels clas siﬁcation conﬁdences resulting in better classiﬁers are obtained. the time complexity of the procedure is o resulting in seconds for objects to less than an hour for objects. acknowledgments the authors thank marco loog

      "An agent interacts with an environment and receives real-valued rewards and penalties. The agent’s\n",
      "goal is to maximize the total reward it receives. The economic view makes it easy to formalize\n",

      "goals of prevention (“don’t crash into any other airplanes”) and goals of maintenance (“keep the\n",

      "by giving a positive reward for achieving the goal. Goals of prevention can be represented by\n",
      "giving a negative reward when bad events occur, and goals of maintenance can be represented by\n",

      "which makes them prohibitively expensive for most AI problems. Hence, recent research has fo-\n",

      "\n",
      "3.1 A Motivating Example\n",
      "\n",
      "To make the discussion concrete, let us consider the following simple example. Figure 1 shows\n",
      "a 5-by-5 grid world inhabited by a taxi agent. There are four specially-designated locations in\n",
      "this world, marked as R(ed), B(lue), G(reen), and Y(ellow). The taxi problem is episodic.\n",
      "In\n",
      "each episode, the taxi starts in a randomly-chosen square. There is a passenger at one of the\n",
      "four locations (chosen randomly), and that passenger wishes to be transported to one of the four\n",
      "locations (also chosen randomly). The taxi must go to the passenger’s location (the “source”), pick\n",
      "up the passenger, go to the destination location (the “destination”), and put down the passenger\n",
      "there. (To keep things uniform, the taxi must pick up and drop oﬀ the passenger even if he/she\n",
      "is already located at the destination!) The episode ends when the passenger is deposited at the\n",
      "destination location.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are six primitive actions in this domain: (a) four navigation actions that move the taxi\n",
      "one square North, South, East, or West, (b) a Pickup action, and (c) a Putdown action. Each action\n",
      "is deterministic. There is a reward of −1 for each action and an additional reward of +20 for\n",
      "successfully delivering the passenger. There is a reward of −10 if the taxi attempts to execute the\n",
      "Putdown or Pickup actions illegally. If a navigation action would cause the taxi to hit a wall, the\n",
      "action is a no-op, and there is only the usual reward of −1.\n",
      "\n",
      "We seek a policy that maximizes the total reward per episode. There are 500 possible states:\n",
      "25 squares, 5 locations for the passenger (counting the four starting locations and the taxi), and 4\n",
      "destinations.\n",
      "\n",
      "This task has a simple hierarchical structure in which there are two main sub-tasks: Get\n",
      "the passenger and Deliver the passenger. Each of these subtasks in turn involves the subtask\n",
      "of navigating to one of the four locations and then performing a Pickup or Putdown action.\n",
      "\n",

      "and “Deliver the passenger” subtasks. We will show below that the MAXQ method provides a\n",
      "value function representation and learning algorithm that supports temporal abstraction, state\n",
      "abstraction, and subtask sharing.\n",
      "\n",
      "To construct a MAXQ decomposition for the taxi problem, we must identify a set of individual\n",

      "\n",
      "the four target locations, which will be indicated by the formal parameter t.\n",
      "\n",
      "• Get. In this subtask, the goal is to move the taxi from its current location to the passenger’s\n",
      "\n",
      "current location and pick up the passenger.\n",
      "\n",
      "• Put. The goal of this subtask is to move the taxi from the current location to the passenger’s\n",
      "\n",
      "destination location and drop oﬀ the passenger.\n",
      "\n",
      "• Root. This is the whole taxi task.\n",
      "\n",
      "Each of these subtasks is deﬁned by a subgoal, and each subtask terminates when the subgoal\n",
      "\n",
      "is achieved.\n",
      "\n",
      "After deﬁning these subtasks, we must indicate for each subtask which other subtasks or prim-\n",
      "itive actions it should employ to reach its goal. For example, the Navigate(t) subtask should use\n",
      "the four primitive actions North, South, East, and West. The Get subtask should use the Navigate\n",
      "subtask and the Pickup primitive action, and so on.\n",
      "\n",
      "All of this information can be summarized by a directed acyclic graph called the task graph,\n",
      "which is shown in Figure 2. In this graph, each node corresponds to a subtask or a primitive action,\n",
      "and each edge corresponds to a potential way in which one subtask can “call” one of its child tasks.\n",
      "The notation f ormal/actual (e.g., t/source) tells how a formal parameter is to be bound to an\n",
      "actual parameter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now suppose that for each of these subtasks, we write a policy (e.g., as a computer program)\n",
      "to achieve the subtask. We will refer to the policy for a subtask as a “subroutine”, and we can\n",

      "In his (1998b) dissertation work, Ron Parr considered an approach to hierarchical reinforcement\n",
      "learning in which the programmer encodes prior knowledge in the form of a hierarchy of ﬁnite-state\n",
      "controllers called a HAM (Hierarchy of Abstract Machines). The hierarchy is executed using a\n",
      "procedure-call-and-return discipline, and it provides a partial policy for the task. The policy is\n",
      "partial because each machine can include non-deterministic, “choice” machine states, in which the\n",
      "machine lists several options for action but does not specify which one should be chosen. The\n",
      "programmer puts “choice” states at any point where he/she does not know what action should\n",

      "where s is a state (of the external environment) and m contains all of the internal state of the\n",
      "hierarchy (i.e., the contents of the procedure call stack and the values of the current machine states\n",

      "must have two child subtasks, ToWall and FollowWall that were simply internal states of\n",
      "MSniﬀ. This is necessary, because a subtask in the MAXQ framework cannot contain any\n",

      "executes a sequence of 6 primitive actions (one step back, ﬁve stes in direction p). But to\n",

      "• BackOne(d, x, y). This moves the agent one step backwards (in the direction opposite to d.\n",
      "It needs the starting x and y position in order to tell when it has succeeded. It terminates\n",

      "condition is the same as its termination condition.\n",
      "\n",
      "• PerpThree(p, x, y). This moves the agent three steps in the direction p. It needs the starting\n",
      "x and y positions in order to tell when it has succeeded. It terminates when it has moved at\n",
      "least three units in the direction p or if there is a wall in that direction. The goal condition\n",
      "is the same as the termination condition.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "From this, we can see that there are three major diﬀerences between the MAXQ representation\n",
      "and the HAM representation. First, a HAM ﬁnite-state controller can contain internal states. To\n",
      "convert them into a MAXQ subtask graph, we must make a separate subtask for each internal state\n",
      "in the HAM. Second, a HAM can terminate based on an “amount of eﬀort” (e.g., performing 5\n",
      "actions), whereas a MAXQ subtask must terminate based on some change in the state of the world.\n",
      "It is impossible to deﬁne a MAXQ subtask that performs k steps and then terminate regardless of\n",
      "the eﬀects of those steps (i.e., without adding some kind of “counter” to the state of the MDP).\n",
      "Third, it is more diﬃcult to formulate the termination conditions for MAXQ subtasks than for\n",
      "HAM machines. For example, in the HAM, it was not necessary to specify that the MExitHallway\n",
      "machine terminates when it has entered a diﬀerent intersection than the one where the MGo was\n",
      "executed. However, this is important for the MAXQ method, because in MAXQ, each subtask\n",
      "learns its own value function and policy—independent of its parent tasks. For example, without\n",
      "the requirement to enter a diﬀerent intersection, the learning algorithms for MAXQ will always\n",
      "prefer to have MaxExitHall take one step backward and return to the room in which the Go action\n",
      "was started (because that is a much easier terminated state to reach). This problem does not arise\n",
      "\n",
      "54\n",
      "\n",
      "\f",
      "in the HAM approach, because the policy learned for a subtask depends on the whole “ﬂattened”\n",
      "hierarchy of machines, and returning to the state where the Go action was started does not help\n",
      "solve the overall problem of reaching the goal state in the lower right corner.\n",
      "\n",
      "To construct the MAXQ graph for this problem, we have introduced three programming tricks:\n",
      "(a) binding parameters to aspects of the current state (in order to serve as a kind of “local memory”\n",
      "for where the subtask began executing), (b) having a parameterized primitive action (in order to be\n",
      "able to pass a parameter value that speciﬁes which primitive action to perform), and (c) employing\n",
      "“inheritance of termination conditions”—that is, each subtask in this MAXQ graph (but not the\n",
      "others in this paper) inherits the termination conditions of all of its ancestor tasks. Hence, if the\n",
      "agent is in the middle of executing a ToWall action when it leaves an intersection, the ToWall\n",
      "subroutine terminates because the ExitInter subroutine has terminated.\n",
      "If this satisﬁes the goal\n",
      "condition of ExitInter, then it is also considered to satisfy the goal condition of ToWall. This\n",
      "inheritance made it easier to write the MAXQ graph, because the parents did not need to pass\n",
      "down to their children all of the information necessary to deﬁne the complete termination and goal\n",
      "predicates.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are essentially no opportunities for state abstraction in this task, because there are no ir-\n",
      "relevant features of the state. There are some opportunities to apply the Shielding and Termination\n",
      "properties, however. In particular, ExitHall(d) is guaranteed to cause its parent task, MaxGo(d) to\n",
      "terminate, so it does not require any stored C values. There are many states where some subtasks\n",
      "are terminated (e.g., Go(East) in any state where there is a wall on the east side of the room), and\n",
      "so no C values need to be stored.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nonetheless, even after applying the state elimination conditions, the MAXQ representation for\n",
      "this task requires much more space than a ﬂat representation. An exact computation is diﬃcult,\n",
      "but after applying MAXQ-Q learning, the MAXQ representation required 52,043 values, whereas\n",
      "ﬂat Q learning requires fewer than 16,704 values. Parr states that his method requires only 4,300\n",
      "values.\n",
      "\n",
      "To test the relative eﬀectiveness of the MAXQ representation, we compare MAXQ-Q learning\n",
      "with ﬂat Q learning. Because of the very large negative values that some states acquire (particularly\n",
      "during the early phases of learning), we were unable to get Boltzmann exploration to work well—\n",
      "one very bad trial would cause an action to receive such a low Q value, that it would never be tried\n",
      "again. Hence, we experimented with both ǫ-greedy exploration and counter-based exploration. The\n",
      "ǫ-greedy exploration policy is an ordered, abstract GLIE policy in which a random action is chosen\n",
      "with probability ǫ, and ǫ is gradually decreased over time. The counter-based exploration policy\n",
      "keeps track of how many times each action a has been executed in each state s. To choose an\n",
      "action in state s, it selects the action that has been executed the fewest times until all actions\n",
      "have been executed T times. Then it switches to greedy execution. Hence, it is not a genuine\n",
      "GLIE policy. Parr employed counter-based exploration policies in his experiments with this task.\n",
      "For Flat Q learning, we chose the following parameters:\n",
      "learning rate 0.50, initial value for ǫ of\n",
      "1.0, ǫ decreased by 0.001 after each successful execution of a Max node, and initial Q values of\n",
      "−200.123. For MAXQ-Q learning, we chose the following parameters: counter-based exploration\n",
      "with T = 10, learning rate equal to the reciprocal of the number of times an action had been\n",
      "performed, and initial values for the C values selected carefully to provide underestimates of the\n",
      "true C values. For example, the initial values for QExitInter were −40.123, because in the worst\n",

      "task and hence, complete the Go parent task.\n",

      "\n",
      "Learning\n",
      "\n",
      "At the start of this paper, we discussed four issues concerning the design of hierarchical reinforce-\n",
      "ment learning architectures. In this section, we want to highlight a tradeoﬀ between two of those\n",
      "issues: the method for deﬁning subtasks and the use of state abstraction.\n",
      "\n",
      "MAXQ deﬁnes subtasks using a termination predicate Ti and a pseudo-reward function ˜R. There\n",
      "are at least two drawbacks of this method. First, it can be hard for the programmer to deﬁne Ti\n",
      "and ˜R correctly, since this essentially requires guessing the value function of the optimal policy\n",
      "for the MDP at all states where the subtask terminates. Second, it leads us to seek a recursively\n",
      "optimal policy rather than a hierarchically optimal policy. Recursively optimal policies may be\n",
      "much worse than hierarchically optimal ones, so we may be giving up substantial performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, in return for these two drawbacks, MAXQ obtains a very important beneﬁt: the\n",
      "policies and value functions for subtasks become context-free. In other words, they do not depend\n",
      "on their parent tasks or the larger context in which they are invoked. To understand this point,\n",
      "consider again the MDP shown in Figure 6.\n",
      "It is clear that the optimal policy for exiting the\n",
      "left-hand room (the Exit subtask) depends on the location of the goal. If it is at the top of the\n",
      "right-hand room, then the agent should prefer to exit via the upper door, whereas if it is at the\n",
      "bottom of the right-hand room, the agent should prefer to exit by the lower door. However, if\n",
      "we deﬁne the subtask of exiting the left-hand room using a pseudo-reward of zero for both doors,\n",
      "\n",
      "56\n",
      "\n",
      "\f",
      "then we obtain a policy that is not optimal in either case, but a policy that we can re-use in both\n",
      "cases. Furthermore, this policy does not depend on the location of the goal. Hence, we can apply\n",
      "Max node irrelevance to solve the Exit subtask using only the location of the robot and ignore the\n",
      "location of the goal.\n",
      "\n",
      "This example shows that we obtain the beneﬁts of subtask reuse and state abstraction because\n",
      "we deﬁne the subtask using a termination predicate and a pseudo-reward function. The termination\n",
      "predicate and pseudo-reward function provide a barrier that prevents “communication” of value\n",
      "information between the Exit subtask and its context.\n",
      "\n",
      "Compare this to Parr’s HAM method. The HAMQ algorithm ﬁnds the best policy consistent\n",
      "with the hierarchy. To achieve this, it must permit information to propagate “into” the Exit subtask\n",
      "(i.e., the Exit ﬁnite-state controller) from its environment. But this means that if any state that is\n",
      "reached after leaving the Exit subtask has diﬀerent values depending on the location of the goal,\n",
      "then these diﬀerent values will propagate back into the Exit subtask. To represent these diﬀerent\n",
      "values, the Exit subtask must know the location of the goal. In short, to achieve a hierarchically\n",
      "optimal policy within the Exit subtask, we must (in general) represent its value function using the\n",
      "entire state space.\n",
      "\n",
      "We can see, therefore, that there is a direct tradeoﬀ between achieving hierarchical optimality\n",
      "and achieving recursive optimality. Methods for hierarchical optimality have more freedom in\n",
      "deﬁning subtasks (e.g., using complete policies, as in the option approach, or using partial policies,\n",
      "as in the HAM approach). But they cannot employ state abstractions within subtasks, and in\n",
      "general, they cannot reuse the solution of one subtask in multiple contexts. Methods for recursive\n",
      "optimality, on the other hand, must deﬁne subtasks using some method (such as pseudo-reward\n",
      "functions) that isolates the subtask from its context. But in return, they can apply state abstraction\n",
      "and the learned policy can be reused in many contexts (where it will be more or less optimal).\n",
      "\n",
      "It is interesting that the iterative method described by Dean and Lin (1995) can be viewed as\n",
      "a method for moving along this tradeoﬀ. In the Dean and Lin method, the programmer makes an\n",
      "initial guess for the values of the terminal states of each subtask (i.e., the doorways in Figure 6).\n",
      "Based on this initial guess, the locally optimal policies for the subtasks are computed. Then\n",
      "the locally optimal policy for the parent task is computed—while holding the subtask policies\n",
      "ﬁxed (i.e., treating them as options). At this point, their algorithm has computed the recursively\n",
      "optimal solution to the original problem, given the initial guesses. Instead of solving the various\n",
      "subproblems sequentially via an oﬄine algorithm, we could use the MAXQ-Q learning algorithm.\n",
      "But the method of Dean and Lin does not stop here. Instead, it computes new values of the\n",
      "terminal states of each subtask based on the learned value function for the entire problem. This\n",
      "allows it to update its “guesses” for the values of the terminal states. The entire solution process\n",
      "can now be repeated. To obtain a new recursively optimal solution, based on the new guesses.\n",
      "They prove that if this process is iterated indeﬁnitely, it will converge to the recursively optimal\n",
      "policy (provided, of course, that no state abstractions are used within the subtasks).\n",
      "\n",
      "This suggests an extension to MAXQ-Q learning that adapts the ˜R values online. Each time a\n",
      "subtask terminates, we could update the ˜R function based on the computed value of the terminated\n",
      "state. To be precise, if j is a subtask of i, then when j terminates in state s′, we should update\n",
      "˜R(j, s′) to be equal to ˜V (i, s′) = maxa′ ˜Q(i, s′, a′). However, this will only work if ˜R(j, s′) is\n",
      "represented using the full state s′. If subtask j is employing state abstractions, x = χ(s), then\n",
      "˜R(j, x′) will need to be the average value of ˜V (i, s′), where the average is taken over all states s′ such\n",
      "that x′ = χ(s′) (weighted by the probability of visiting those states). This is easily accomplished\n",
      "by performing a stochastic approximation update of the form\n",
      "\n",
      "˜R(j, x′) = (1 − αt) ˜R(j, x′) + αt ˜V (i, s′)\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",

      "each time subtask j terminates. Such an algorithm could be expected to converge to the best\n",
      "hierarchical policy consistent with the given state abstractions.\n",
      "\n",
      "This also suggests that in some problems, it may be worthwhile to ﬁrst learn a recursively\n",
      "optimal policy using very aggressive state abstractions and then use the learned value function\n",
      "to initialize a MAXQ representation with a more detailed representation of the states. These\n",
      "progressive reﬁnements of the state space could be guided by monitoring the degree to which the\n",
      "values of ˜V (i, s′) vary for a single abstract state x′. If they have a large variance, this means that\n",
      "the state abstractions are failing to make important distinctions in the values of the states, and\n",
      "they should be reﬁned.\n",
      "\n",
      "Both of these kinds of adaptive algorithms will take longer to converge than the basic MAXQ\n",
      "method described in this paper. But for tasks that an agent must solve many times in its lifetime,\n",
      "it is worthwhile to have learning algorithms that provide an initial useful solution but gradually\n",
      "improve that solution until it is optimal. An important goal for future research is to ﬁnd methods\n",

      "the optimal policy is discovered.\n",
      "\n",
      "9 Concluding Remarks\n",
      "\n",
      "This paper has introduced a new representation for the value function in hierarchical reinforcement\n",
      "learning—the MAXQ value function decomposition. We have proved that the MAXQ decompo-\n",
      "sition can represent the value function of any hierarchical policy under both the ﬁnite-horizon\n",
      "undiscounted, cumulative reward criterion and the inﬁnite-horizon discounted reward criterion.\n",
      "This representation supports subtask sharing and re-use, because the overall value function is de-\n",
      "composed into value functions for individual subtasks.\n",
      "\n",
      "The paper introduced a learning algorithm, MAXQ-Q learning, and proved that it converges\n",
      "with probability 1 to a recursively optimal policy. The paper argued that although recursive\n",
      "optimality is weaker than either hierarchical optimality or global optimality, it is an important\n",
      "form of optimality because it permits each subtask to learn a locally optimal policy while ignoring\n",
      "the behavior of its ancestors in the MAXQ graph. This increases the opportunities for subtask\n",
      "sharing and state abstraction.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have shown that the MAXQ decomposition creates opportunities for state abstraction, and\n",
      "we identiﬁed a set of ﬁve properties (Max Node Irrelevance, Leaf Irrelevance, Result Distribution\n",
      "Irrelevance, Shielding, and Termination) that allow us to ignore large parts of the state space\n",
      "within subtasks. We proved that MAXQ-Q still converges in the presence of these forms of state\n",
      "abstraction, and we showed experimentally that state abstraction is important in practice for the\n",
      "successful application of MAXQ-Q learning—at least in the Taxi and Kaelbling HDG tasks.\n",
      "\n",
      "The paper presented two diﬀerent methods for deriving improved non-hierarchical policies from\n",
      "the MAXQ value function representation, and it has formalized the conditions under which these\n",
      "methods can improve over the hierarchical policy. The paper veriﬁed experimentally that non-\n",
      "hierarchical execution gives improved performance in the Fickle Taxi Task (where it achieves opti-\n",
      "mal performance) and in the HDG task (where it gives a substantial improvement).\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, the paper has argued that there is a tradeoﬀ governing the design of hierarchical rein-\n",
      "forcement learning methods. At one end of the design spectrum are “context free” methods such\n",
      "as MAXQ. They provide good support for state abstraction and subtask sharing but they can only\n",
      "learn recursively optimal policies. At the other end of the spectrum are “context-sensitive” meth-\n",
      "ods such as HAMQ, the options framework, and the early work of Dean and Lin. These methods\n",
      "can discover hierarchically optimal policies (or, in some cases, globally optimal policies), but their\n",
      "\n",
      "58\n",
      "\n",
      "\f",
      "drawback is that they cannot easily exploit state abstractions or share subtasks. Because of the\n",
      "great speedups that are enabled by state abstraction, this paper has argued that the context-free\n",
      "approach is to be preferred—and that it can be relaxed as needed to obtain improved policies.\n",
