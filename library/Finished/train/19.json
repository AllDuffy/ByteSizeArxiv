        "consider an agent interacting with an environment in cycles . in every interaction cycle the agent is rewarded for its performance . we compare the average reward u from cycle to m with the future discounted reward v from cycle k to infinity . we consider essentially arbitrary discount sequences and arbitrary reward sequences . we show that asymptotically u for m infinity and v for k infinity are equal provided both limits exist . further if the effective horizon grows linearly with k or faster then existence of the limit of u implies that the limit of v exists . conversely if the effective horizon grows linearly with k or slower then existence of the limit of v implies that the limit of u exists ."
