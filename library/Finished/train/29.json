    "abstract": [
        "we present basic notions of gold s learnability in the limit paradigm first presented in a formalization of the cognitive process by which a native speaker gets to grasp the underlying grammar of his her own native language by being exposed to well formed sentences generated by that grammar . then we present lambek grammars a formalism issued from categorial grammars which although not as expressive as needed for a full formalization of natural languages is particularly suited to easily implement a natural interface between syntax and semantics . in the last part of this work we present a learnability result for rigid lambek grammars from structured examples ."
