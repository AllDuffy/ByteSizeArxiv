        "introduction in we suggested a new methodology for designing forecasting strategies . considering only the simplest case of binary forecasting we showed that any constructive in the sense explained below law of probability can be translated in this paper this result into a forecasting strategy that satisfies this law . is extended to a general class of protocols including multi class forecasting . in proposing this approach to forecasting we were inspired by and papers further developing although our methods and formal results appear to be completely di\ufb00erent . whereas the meta theorem stated in is mathematically trivial the generalization considered in this paper is less so depending on the schauder tikhonov fixed point theorem . our general meta theorem is stated in and appendix a. the general forecasting protocols covered by this result are introduced and discussed in and proved in . in we demonstrated the value of the meta theorem by applying it to the strong law of large numbers obtaining from it a kernel forecasting strategy which we called k. the derivation however was informal involving heuristic transitions to a limit and this made it impossible to state formally any properties of k. in this paper we deduce k in a much more direct way from the weak law of large numbers and state its properties . the weak law of large numbers is stated and proved in and k is derived and studied in . we call the approach to forecasting using our meta theorem defensive forecasting forecaster is trying to defend himself when playing against skeptic . the justification of this approach given in this paper and in is k s properties of proper calibration and resolution . another justification in a sense the ultimate justification of any forecasts is given in defensive forecasts lead to good decisions this result however is obtained in for rather simple decision problems requiring only binary forecasts and its extensions will require this paper s results or their generalizations . the exposition of probability theory needed for this paper is given in . the standard exposition is based on kolmogorov s measure theoretic axioms of probability whereas states several key laws of probability in terms of a game between the forecaster the reality and a third player the skeptic . the game theoretic laws of probability in are constructive in that we explicitly construct computable winning strategies for the forecaster in various games of forecasting . forecasting as a game following and we consider the following general forecasting protocol forecasting game players reality forecaster skeptic parameters x y f protocol k. for n. x. reality announces xn forecaster announces fn s. skeptic announces sn y. reality announces yn kn \u03bb . kn end for f. restriction on skeptic skeptic must choose the sn so that his capital is always nonnegative no matter how the other players move . kn this is a perfect information protocol the players move in the order indicated it specifies and each player sees the other player s moves as they are made . both an initial value for skeptic s capital and a lower bound on its subsequent values . we will say that xn are the data yn are the kn observations and fn are the forecasts . in applications the datum xn will contain all available information deemed useful in forecasting yn . book contains several results of the following form skeptic has a strategy that guarantees that either a property of agreement between the forecasts fn and observations yn is satisfied or skeptic becomes very rich . all specific strategies considered in have computable versions . according to brouwer s principle they must be automatically continuous in any case their continuity can be checked directly . in we showed that under a special choice of the players move spaces and skeptic s gain function \u03bb for any continuous strategy for skeptic forecaster has a strategy that guarantees that skeptic s capital never increases when he plays that strategy . therefore forecaster has strategies that ensure various properties of agreement between the forecasts and the observations . the purpose of this paper is to extend the result of to a wide class of skeptic s gain functions \u03bb . but first we consider several important special cases of forecasting game . binary forecasting the simplest non trivial case considered in is where y s r and f \u03bb sn . intuitively forecaster gives probability forecasts for yn fn is his subjective probability that yn . the operational interpretation of fn is that it is the price that forecaster charges for a ticket that will pay yn at the end of the nth round of the game sn is the number of such tickets that skeptic chooses to buy . bounded regression this is the most straightforward extension of binary forecasting considered in . . the move spaces are y f where a and b are two constants and s r the gain function is as before . this protocol allows one to prove a strong law of large numbers and a simple one sided law of the iterated logarithm . multi class forecasting another extension of binary forecasting is the protocol where y is a finite set f is the set of all probability distributions on y s is the set of all real valued functions on y and \u03bb sn sn dfn . z the intuition behind skeptic s move sn is that skeptic buys the ticket which pays sn after yn is announced he is charged sn dfn for this ticket . the binary forecasting protocol is isomorphic to the special case of this protocol where y forecaster s move fn in the binary forecasting protocol is represented by the probability distribution f assigning and skeptic s move sn in the binary forecasting protocol is weight fn to s such that s represented by any function s n sn . the isomorphism between these two protocols follows from n on n on n bounded mean variance forecasting in this protocol y where a and b are again two constants f s r and \u03bb \u03bb mn of his first forecast with a number vn . this protocol the accuracy vn an equivalent representation of this protocol is y f s r and \u03bb \u03bb s n s f n. n the equivalence of the two representations can be seen as follows reality s move in the first representation corresponds to in the second representation forecaster s move in the first repren f sentation corresponds to in the second representan s tion and skeptic s move in the second representation corresponds to in the first representation . this establishes a bijection between reality s move spaces a bijection between forecaster s move spaces and a bijection between skeptic s move spaces in the two representations skeptic s gains are also the same in the two representations n mns s n s f n s n n tn mn m n mn s n vn m n mn tn vn . forecasting game is too general to derive results of the kind we are interested in . in this subsection we will introduce a narrower protocol which will still be wide enough to cover all special cases considered so far . all move spaces are now subsets of a hilbert space l. the observation space is a nonempty pre compact subset y l forecaster s move space f is the whole of l and skeptic s move space s is also the whole of l. skeptic s gain function is therefore we consider the following perfect information game \u03bb sn yn h fni l. forecasting game players reality forecaster skeptic parameters x l y protocol k. for n. x. reality announces xn forecaster announces fn l. skeptic announces sn y. reality announces yn fni sn yn kn kn h end for l. l. restriction on skeptic skeptic must choose the sn so that his capital is always nonnegative no matter how the other players move . let us check that the specific protocols considered in the previous section are covered by this linear protocol . at first sight even the binary forecasting protocol is not covered as forecaster s move space is f rather than r. it is easy to see however that forecaster s move fn co y outside the convex closure co y of the observation space is always inadmissible in the sense that there exists skeptic s reply sn making him arbitrarily rich regardless of reality s move and so we can as well choose f co y. co y in the linear protocol . since y indeed suppose that fn is pre compact co y is compact . by the hahn banach theorem there exists a vector sn inf y y h l such that l. fni sn y or co y to be compact in fact skeptic s move csn can make him as rich as he wishes as c can be arbitrarily large . in what follows we will usually assume that forecaster s move space is co y and use f as a shorthand for co y. fn we will see in the next section that the feature space version of the weak law of large numbers is much more useful than the standard version for the purpose of forecasting . the k strategy and its properties according to theorem under the continuity assumption there is a strategy for forecaster that does not allow kn is defined by . fortunately this strategy depends on the feature mapping \u03c6 only via the corresponding kernel k defined by . the continuity assumption needed is that k should be continuous in f such kernels will be called admissible . according to the corresponding forecasting strategy which we will call the k strategy with parameter k is to output on the nth kn to grow where round a forecast fn satisfying s k n i x. f where the protocol of this section is essentially that of forecasting game as skeptic ceases to be an active player it simplifies to for n. x. reality announces xn forecaster announces fn y. reality announces yn co y. end for theorem the k strategy guarantees that always \u03c6 diamc\u03c6 n n i x l h where c\u03c6 sup f x \u03c6 k proof the k strategy ensures that never increases therefore h is assumed to be finite . k n n \u03c6 yi k fik \u03c6 k k l h diamc \u03c6n . l h i x i x remark the property is a special case of corresponding to \u03b4 we gave an independent derivation to make our exposition self contained and to avoid the extra assumptions used in the derivation of such as the horizon being finite and known in advance . k with reproducing kernel hilbert spaces f on some set z such that all evaluation functionals f a reproducing kernel hilbert space is a function f space z are continuous . we will be interested in rkhs on the cartesian product z x. f by the riesz fischer theorem for each z f z there exists a function kz f f. f kz f h f i f such that let cf sup kzkf z z k the kernel of an rkhs we will be interested in the case cf on z is f k. kz kz h. it is clear that is a special case of the generalization k if \u03c6 \u03c6 h i h of . in fact the functions k that can be represented as are exactly the functions that can be represented as they can be equivalently defined as symmetric positive definite functions on z. a long list of rkhs together with their kernels is given in . . we will of absolutely continuous functions only give one example the sobolev space f on r with finite norm s f ks k sz z f dz dz k exp . example . from the last equation we can see that the following is an easy corollary of theorem . be an rkhs on f x. the k strategy with parameter f where cf is defined by . l diamcf f kf n k h be defined by \u03c6 kz . theorem then f kfi xi f ih yi f l h i x n i x n diamcf kfi xi kf n f k l fi f l l f f k kf . its kernel is see or cs . theorem let k ensures f n i x for each function f proof let \u03c6 f implies f x n i x n calibration and resolution two important properties of a forecasting strategy are its calibration and resolution which we introduce informally . our discussion in this section extends the discussion in to the case of linear protocols . forecaster s move space is assumed to be f co y. we say that the forecasts fn are properly calibrated if for any f f i ... n fi f yi i ... n fi f f p p i ... n fi f is not too small . proper calibration is only a necessary p but far from sufficient condition for good forecasts for example a forecaster who ignores the data xn can be perfectly calibrated no matter how much useful information xn contain . we say that the forecasts fn are properly calibrated and resolved if for any f x i ... n yi i ... n i ... n is not too small . p p f provided f f x p instead of crisp points x one may consider fuzzy points such that i and i for all outside i f a small neighborhood of . a standard choice would be something like i ie where e x is a small neighborhood of and ie is its indicator function but we will want i to be continuous . suppose f be a point in f containing this point e well approximated by the tensor product rl for some m l rm and x x consider a small box e. let . l m j i. the indicator ie of e can be arbitrarily q q i fi gj m i y l j y f of m l copies of of some functions fi and gj from the sobolev class . let of i in the tensor product description of tensor products of rkhs . we can rewrite as kf n i i therefore we can expect assuming the denominator proper calibration and resolution in the soft neighborhood i of when diam i k n i i kf be the norm i k i. for an explicit m l p p p s n p n i x i n. further research the main result of this paper is an existence theorem we did not show how to compute forecaster s strategy ensuring it is important to develop computationally efficient ways to find zeros of vector fields at least when l rm . there are several popular methods for finding zeros such as the newton raphson method but it would be ideal to have efficient methods that are guaranteed to find a zero in a prespecified time . k k.

        "we consider a general class of forecasting protocols called linear protocols and discuss several important special cases including multi class forecasting . forecasting is formalized as a game between three players reality whose role is to generate observations forecaster whose goal is to predict the observations and skeptic who tries to make money on any lack of agreement between forecaster s predictions and the actual observations . our main mathematical result is that for any continuous strategy for skeptic in a linear protocol there exists a strategy for forecaster that does not allow skeptic s capital to grow . this result is a meta theorem that allows one to transform any continuous law of probability in a linear protocol into a forecasting strategy whose predictions are guaranteed to satisfy this law . we apply this meta theorem to a weak law of large numbers in hilbert spaces to obtain a version of the k prediction algorithm for linear protocols and show that this version also satisfies the attractive properties of proper calibration and resolution under a suitable choice of its kernel parameter with no assumptions about the way the data is generated ."
