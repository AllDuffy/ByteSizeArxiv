A robustness certificate is the minimum distance of a given input to the
decision boundary of the classifier . For input
perturbations with a magnitude smaller than the certificate value the
classification output will provably remain unchanged . Exactly computing the
robustness certificates for neural networks is difficult since it requires
solving a non convex optimization . In this paper we provide
computationally efficient robustness certificates for neural networks with
differentiable activation functions in two steps . First we show that if the
eigenvalues of the Hessian of the network are bounded we can compute a
robustness certificate in the l _ norm efficiently using convex optimization .
Second we derive a computationally efficient differentiable upper bound on the
curvature of a deep network . We also use the curvature bound as a
regularization term during the training of the network to boost its certified
robustness . Putting these results together leads to our proposed urvature based obustness ertificate and urvature based obust raining . Our numerical results show
that CRT leads to significantly higher certified robust accuracy compared to
interval bound propagation based training . We achieve certified robust
accuracy . . and . while IBP based methods achieve .
