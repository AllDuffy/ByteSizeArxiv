A Combined Approach To Detect Key Variables In Thick Data Analytics
#####
In machine learning one of the strategic tasks is the selection of only
significant variables as predictors for the response . In this paper an
approach is proposed which consists in the application of permutation tests on
the candidate predictor variables in the aim of identifying only the most
informative ones . Several industrial problems may benefit from such an
approach and an application in the field of chemical analysis is presented . A
comparison is carried out between the approach proposed and Lasso that is one
of the most common alternatives for feature selection available in the
literature .
