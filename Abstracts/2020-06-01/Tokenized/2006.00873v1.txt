A Generalised Signature Method for Time Series
#####
The signature method refers to a collection of feature extraction
techniques for multimodal sequential data derived from the theory of
controlled differential equations . Variations exist as many authors have
proposed modifications to the method so as to improve some aspect of it . Here
we introduce a emph that contains these
variations as special cases and groups them conceptually into
emph emph emph and emph .
Within this framework we are then able to propose novel variations and
demonstrate how previously distinct options may be combined . We go on to
perform an extensive empirical study on datasets as to which aspects of this
framework typically produce the best results . Combining the top choices
produces a canonical pipeline for the generalised signature method which
demonstrates state of the art accuracy on benchmark problems in multivariate
time series classification .
