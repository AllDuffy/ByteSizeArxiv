Residual Squeeze and Excitation Network for Fast Image Deraining
#####
Image deraining is an important image processing task as rain streaks not
only severely degrade the visual quality of images but also significantly
affect the performance of high level vision tasks . Traditional methods
progressively remove rain streaks via different recurrent neural networks .
However these methods fail to yield plausible rain free images in an efficient
manner . In this paper we propose a residual squeeze and excitation network
called RSEN for fast image deraining as well as superior deraining performance
compared with state of the art approaches . Specifically RSEN adopts a
lightweight encoder decoder architecture to conduct rain removal in one stage .
Besides both encoder and decoder adopt a novel residual squeeze and excitation
block as the core of feature extraction which contains a residual block for
producing hierarchical features followed by a squeeze and excitation block for
channel wisely enhancing the resulted hierarchical features . Experimental
results demonstrate that our method can not only considerably reduce the
computational complexity but also significantly improve the deraining
performance compared with state of the art methods .
