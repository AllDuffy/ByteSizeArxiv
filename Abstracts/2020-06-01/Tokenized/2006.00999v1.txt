A Neural Network Model of Lexical Competition during Infant Spoken Word
Recognition
#####
Visual world studies show that upon hearing a word in a target absent visual
context containing related and unrelated items toddlers and adults briefly
direct their gaze towards phonologically related items before shifting towards
semantically and visually related ones . We present a neural network model that
processes dynamic unfolding phonological representations and maps them to
static internal semantic and visual representations . The model trained on
representations derived from real corpora simulates this early phonological
over semantic visual preference . Our results support the hypothesis that
incremental unfolding of a spoken word is in itself sufficient to account for
the transient preference for phonological competitors over both unrelated and
semantically and visually related ones . Phonological representations mapped
dynamically in a bottom up fashion to semantic visual representations capture
the early phonological preference effects reported in a visual world task . The
semantic visual preference observed later in such a trial does not require
top down feedback from a semantic or visual system .
