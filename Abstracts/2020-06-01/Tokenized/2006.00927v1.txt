Treatment Policy Learning in Multiobjective Settings with Fully Observed
Outcomes
#####
In several medical decision making problems such as antibiotic prescription
laboratory testing can provide precise indications for how a patient will
respond to different treatment options . This enables us to fully observe all
potential treatment outcomes but while present in historical data these
results are infeasible to produce in real time at the point of the initial
treatment decision . Moreover treatment policies in these settings often need
to trade off between multiple competing objectives such as effectiveness of
treatment and harmful side effects . We present compare and evaluate three
approaches for learning individualized treatment policies in this setting
First we consider two indirect approaches which use predictive models of
treatment response to construct policies optimal for different trade offs
between objectives . Second we consider a direct approach that constructs such
a set of policies without any intermediate models of outcomes . Using a medical
dataset of Urinary Tract Infection patients we show that all approaches
are able to find policies that achieve strictly better performance on all
outcomes than clinicians while also trading off between different objectives
as desired . We demonstrate additional benefits of the direct approach
including flexibly incorporating other goals such as deferral to physicians on
simple cases .
