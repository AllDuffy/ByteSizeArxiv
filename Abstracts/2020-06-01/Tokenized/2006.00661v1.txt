Submodular Bandit Problem Under Multiple Constraints
#####
The linear submodular bandit problem was proposed to simultaneously address
diversified retrieval and online learning in a recommender system . If there is
no uncertainty this problem is equivalent to a submodular maximization problem
under a cardinality constraint . However in some situations recommendation
lists should satisfy additional constraints such as budget constraints other
than a cardinality constraint . Thus motivated by diversified retrieval
considering budget constraints we introduce a submodular bandit problem under
the intersection of l knapsacks and a k system constraint . Here k system
constraints form a very general class of constraints including cardinality
constraints and the intersection of k matroid constraints . To solve this
problem we propose a non greedy algorithm that adaptively focuses on a
standard or modified upper confidence bound . We provide a high probability
upper bound of an approximation regret where the approximation ratio matches
that of a fast offline algorithm . Moreover we perform experiments under
various combinations of constraints using a synthetic and two real world
datasets and demonstrate that our proposed methods outperform the existing
baselines .
