Locally Differentially Private Bandits Learning
#####
We study locally differentially private bandits learning in this paper .
First we propose simple black box reduction frameworks that can solve a large
family of context free bandits learning problems with LDP guarantee . Based on
our frameworks we can improve previous best results for private bandits
learning with one point feedback such as private Bandits Convex Optimization
etc and obtain the first results for Bandits Convex Optimization with
multi point feedback under LDP . LDP guarantee and black box nature make our
frameworks more attractive in real applications compared with previous
specifically designed and relatively weaker differentially private
context free bandits algorithms . Further we also extend our algorithm to
Generalized Linear Bandits with regret bound
tilde mathcal T ^ varepsilon under LDP
which is conjectured to be optimal . Note given existing Omega lower bound
for DP contextual linear bandits our result shows
a fundamental difference between LDP and DP contextual bandits learning .
