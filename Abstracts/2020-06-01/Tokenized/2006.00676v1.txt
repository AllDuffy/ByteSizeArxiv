G IDS Generative Adversarial Networks Assisted Intrusion Detection
System
#####
The boundaries of cyber physical systems and the Internet of Things
are converging together day by day to introduce a common platform on
hybrid systems . Moreover the combination of artificial intelligence with
CPS creates a new dimension of technological advancement . All these
connectivity and dependability are creating massive space for the attackers to
launch cyber attacks . To defend against these attacks intrusion detection
system has been widely used . However emerging CPS technologies suffer
from imbalanced and missing sample data which makes the training of IDS
difficult . In this paper we propose a generative adversarial network
based intrusion detection system where GAN generates synthetic
samples and IDS gets trained on them along with the original ones . G IDS also
fixes the difficulties of imbalanced or missing data problems . We model a
network security dataset for an emerging CPS using NSL KDD dataset and
evaluate our proposed model s performance using different metrics . We find that
our proposed G IDS model performs much better in attack detection and model
stabilization during the training process than a standalone IDS .
