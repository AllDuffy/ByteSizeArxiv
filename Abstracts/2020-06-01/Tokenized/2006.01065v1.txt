Hadamard Wirtinger Flow for Sparse Phase Retrieval
#####
We consider the problem of reconstructing an n dimensional k sparse
signal from a set of magnitude only measurements . Formulating the problem as an
unregularized empirical risk minimization task we study the sample complexity
performance of gradient descent with Hadamard parametrization which we call
Hadamard Wirtinger flow . Provided knowledge of the signal sparsity k
we prove that a single step of HWF is able to recover the support from
mathcal k x ^ _ ^ log n samples where x ^ _ is the
largest component of the signal in magnitude . This support recovery procedure
can be used to initialize existing reconstruction methods and yields algorithms
with total runtime proportional to the cost of reading the data and improved
sample complexity which is linear in k when the signal contains at least one
large component . We numerically investigate the performance of HWF at
convergence and show that while not requiring any explicit form of
regularization nor knowledge of k HWF adapts to the signal sparsity and
reconstructs sparse signals with fewer measurements than existing
state of the art methods .
