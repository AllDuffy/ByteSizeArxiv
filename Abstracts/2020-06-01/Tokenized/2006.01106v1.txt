Exit Time Analysis for Approximations of Gradient Descent Trajectories
Around Saddle Points
#####
This paper considers the problem of understanding the exit time for
trajectories of gradient related first order methods from saddle neighborhoods
under some initial boundary conditions . Given the flat geometry around saddle
points first order methods can struggle in escaping these regions in a fast
manner due to the small magnitudes of gradients encountered . In particular
while it is known that gradient related first order methods escape
strict saddle neighborhoods existing literature does not explicitly leverage
the local geometry around saddle points in order to control behavior of
gradient trajectories . It is in this context that this paper puts forth a
rigorous geometric analysis of the gradient descent method around strict saddle
neighborhoods using matrix perturbation theory . In doing so it provides a key
result that can be used to generate an approximate gradient trajectory for any
given initial conditions . In addition the analysis leads to a linear exit time
solution for gradient descent method under certain necessary initial conditions
for a class of strict saddle functions .
