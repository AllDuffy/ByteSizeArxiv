DPDnet A Robust People Detector using Deep Learning with an Overhead
Depth Camera
#####
In this paper we propose a method based on deep learning that detects
multiple people from a single overhead depth image with high reliability . Our
neural network called DPDnet is based on two fully convolutional
encoder decoder neural blocks based on residual layers . The Main Block takes a
depth image as input and generates a pixel wise confidence map where each
detected person in the image is represented by a Gaussian like distribution .
The refinement block combines the depth image and the output from the main
block to refine the confidence map . Both blocks are simultaneously trained
end to end using depth images and head position labels . The experimental work
shows that DPDNet outperforms state of the art methods with accuracies greater
than in three different publicly available datasets without retraining not
fine tuning . In addition the computational complexity of our proposal is
independent of the number of people in the scene and runs in real time using
conventional GPUs .
