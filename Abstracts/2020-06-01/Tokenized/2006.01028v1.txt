Interpretable Stochastic Block Influence Model measuring social
influence among homophilous communities
#####
Decision making on networks can be explained by both homophily and social
influence . While homophily drives the formation of communities with similar
characteristics social influence occurs both within and between communities .
Social influence can be reasoned through role theory which indicates that the
influences among individuals depend on their roles and the behavior of
interest . To operationalize these social science theories we empirically
identify the homophilous communities and use the community structures to
capture the roles which affect the particular decision making processes . We
propose a generative model named Stochastic Block Influence Model and jointly
analyze both the network formation and the behavioral influence within and
between different empirically identified communities . To evaluate the
performance and demonstrate the interpretability of our method we study the
adoption decisions of microfinance in an Indian village . We show that although
individuals tend to form links within communities there are strong positive
and negative social influences between communities supporting the weak tie
theory . Moreover we find that communities with shared characteristics are
associated with positive influence . In contrast the communities with a lack of
overlap are associated with negative influence . Our framework facilitates the
quantification of the influences underlying decision communities and is thus a
useful tool for driving information diffusion viral marketing and technology
