Provable guarantees for decision tree induction the agnostic setting
#####
We give strengthened provable guarantees on the performance of widely
employed and empirically successful . While prior works have focused on the realizable setting we
consider the more realistic and challenging setting . We show
that for all monotone functions f and parameters s in mathbb these
heuristics construct a decision tree of size s ^ tilde varepsilon ^ that achieves error le mathsf_s varepsilon
where mathsf_s denotes the error of the optimal size s decision tree
for f . Previously such a guarantee was not known to be achievable by any
algorithm even one that is not based on top down heuristics . We complement our
algorithmic guarantee with a near matching s ^ tilde lower
bound .
