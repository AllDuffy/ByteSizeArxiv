Temporal Differential Learning in Continuous Environments
#####
In this paper a new reinforcement learning method known as the method
of temporal differential is introduced . Compared to the traditional
temporal difference learning method it plays a crucial role in developing
novel RL techniques for continuous environments . In particular the
continuous time least squares policy evaluation and the
continuous time temporal differential learning methods are developed .
Both theoretical and empirical evidences are provided to demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed temporal differential learning methodology .
