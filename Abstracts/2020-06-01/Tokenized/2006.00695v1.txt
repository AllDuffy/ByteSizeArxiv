Random Hyperboxes
#####
This paper proposes a simple yet powerful ensemble classifier called Random
Hyperboxes constructed from individual hyperbox based classifiers trained on
the random subsets of sample and feature spaces of the training set . We also
show a generalization error bound of the proposed classifier based on the
strength of the individual hyperbox based classifiers as well as the
correlation among them . The effectiveness of the proposed classifier is
analyzed using a carefully selected illustrative example and compared
empirically with other popular single and ensemble classifiers via datasets
using statistical testing methods . The experimental results confirmed that our
proposed method outperformed other fuzzy min max neural networks popular
learning algorithms and is competitive with other ensemble methods . Finally
we identify the existing issues related to the generalization error bounds of
the real datasets and inform the potential research directions .
