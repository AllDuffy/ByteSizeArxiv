Reinforcement learning and Bayesian data assimilation for model informed
precision dosing in oncology
#####
Model informed precision dosing using therapeutic drug biomarker
monitoring offers the opportunity to significantly improve the efficacy and
safety of drug therapies . Current strategies comprise model informed dosing
tables or are based on maximum a posteriori estimates . These approaches
however lack a quantification of uncertainty and or consider only part of the
available patient specific information . We propose three novel approaches for
MIPD employing Bayesian data assimilation and or reinforcement learning
to control neutropenia the major dose limiting side effect in anticancer
chemotherapy . These approaches have the potential to substantially reduce the
incidence of life threatening grade and subtherapeutic grade neutropenia
compared to existing approaches . We further show that RL allows to gain further
insights by identifying patient factors that drive dose decisions . Due to its
flexibility the proposed combined DA RL approach can easily be extended to
integrate multiple endpoints or patient reported outcomes thereby promising
important benefits for future personalized therapies .
