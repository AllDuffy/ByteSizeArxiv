Stance in Replies and Quotes   A New Dataset For Learning Stance in
  Twitter Conversations
#####
Automated ways to extract stance  from
conversations on social media are essential to advance opinion mining research.
Recently  there is a renewed excitement in the field as we see new models
attempting to improve the state of the art. However  for training and
evaluating the models  the datasets used are often small. Additionally  these
small datasets have uneven class distributions  i.e.  only a tiny fraction of
the examples in the dataset have favoring or denying stances  and most other
examples have no clear stance. Moreover  the existing datasets do not
distinguish between the different types of conversations on social media . Because of this  models trained on one event
do not generalize to other events.
  In the presented work  we create a new dataset by labeling stance in
responses to posts on Twitter  on controversial
issues. To the best of our knowledge  this is currently the largest
human labeled stance dataset for Twitter conversations with over  stance
labels. More importantly  we designed a tweet collection methodology that
favors the selection of denial type responses. This class is expected to be
more useful in the identification of rumors and determining antagonistic
relationships between users. Moreover  we include many baseline models for
learning the stance in conversations and compare the performance of various
models. We show that combining data from replies and quotes decreases the
accuracy of models indicating that the two modalities behave differently when
it comes to stance learning.
