Analog ensemble data assimilation and a method for constructing analogs
  with variational autoencoders
#####
It is proposed to use analogs of the forecast mean to generate an ensemble of
perturbations for use in ensemble optimal interpolation  or ensemble
variational  methods. A new method of constructing analogs using
variational autoencoders  is proposed. The
resulting analog methods using analogs from a catalog   and using
constructed analogs   are tested in the context of a multiscale
Lorenz   model  with standard EnOI and an ensemble square root filter for
comparison. The use of analogs from a modestly sized catalog is shown to
improve the performance of EnOI  with limited marginal improvements resulting
from increases in the catalog size. The method using constructed analogs
 is found to perform as well as a full ensemble square root filter 
and to be robust over a wide range of tuning parameters.
