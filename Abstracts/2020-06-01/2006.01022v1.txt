A novel approach for multi agent cooperative pursuit to capture grouped
  evaders
#####
An approach of mobile multi agent pursuit based on application of
self organizing feature map  and along with that reinforcement learning
based on agent group role membership function  model is proposed. This
method promotes dynamic organization of the pursuers  groups and also makes
pursuers  group evader according to their desire based on SOFM and AGRMF
techniques. This helps to overcome the shortcomings of the pursuers that they
cannot fully reorganize when the goal is too independent in process of AGRMF
models operation. Besides  we also discuss a new reward function. After the
formation of the group  reinforcement learning is applied to get the optimal
solution for each agent. The results of each step in capturing process will
finally affect the AGR membership function to speed up the convergence of the
competitive neural network. The experiments result shows that this approach is
more effective for the mobile agents to capture evaders.
