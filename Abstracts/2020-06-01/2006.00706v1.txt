Differentially Private Combinatorial Semi Bandits
#####
In this paper  we study Combinatorial Semi Bandits  that is an extension
of classic Multi Armed Bandits  under Differential Privacy  and
stronger Local Differential Privacy  setting. Since the server receives
more information from users in CSB  it usually causes additional dependence on
the dimension of data  which is a notorious side effect for privacy preserving
learning. However for CSB under two common smoothness assumptions
 cite  we show it is possible to remove
this side effect. In detail  for  B_  bounded smooth CSB under either
  varepsilon  LDP or   varepsilon  DP  we prove the optimal regret bound is
  Theta  frac mB^_ ln T     Delta epsilon^    or
  tilde  frac mB^_ ln T     respectively 
where  T  is time period    Delta  is the gap of rewards and  m  is the number
of base arms  by proposing novel algorithms and matching lower bounds. For
 B_  bounded smooth CSB under   varepsilon  DP  we also prove the optimal
regret bound is   tilde  frac mKB^_ ln T     with
both upper bound and lower bound  where  K  is the maximum number of feedback
in each round. All above results nearly match corresponding non private optimal
rates  which imply there is no additional price for  differentially
private CSB in above common settings.
