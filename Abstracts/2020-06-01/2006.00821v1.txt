Thermal Object Detection using Domain Adaptation through Style
  Consistency
#####
A recent fatal accident of an autonomous vehicle opens a debate about the use
of infrared technology in the sensor suite for autonomous driving to increase
visibility for robust object detection. Thermal imaging has an advantage over
lidar  radar  and camera because it can detect the heat difference emitted by
objects in the infrared spectrum. In contrast  lidar and camera capture in the
visible spectrum  and adverse weather conditions can impact their accuracy. The
limitations of object detection in images from conventional imaging sensors can
be catered to by thermal images. This paper presents a domain adaptation method
for object detection in thermal images. We explore multiple ideas of domain
adaption. First  a generative adversarial network is used to transfer the
low level features from the visible spectrum to the infrared spectrum domain
through style consistency. Second  a cross domain model with style consistency
is used for object detection in the infrared spectrum by transferring the
trained visible spectrum model. The proposed strategies are evaluated on
publicly available thermal image datasets .
We find that adapting the low level features from the source domain to the
target domain through domain adaptation increases in mean average precision by
approximately  .
