Variational Bayesian Inference for Crowdsourcing Predictions
#####
Crowdsourcing has emerged as an effective means for performing a number of
machine learning tasks such as annotation and labelling of images and other
data sets. In most early settings of crowdsourcing  the task involved
classification  that is assigning one of a discrete set of labels to each task.
Recently  however  more complex tasks have been attempted including asking
crowdsource workers to assign continuous labels  or predictions. In essence 
this involves the use of crowdsourcing for function estimation. We are
motivated by this problem to drive applications such as collaborative
prediction  that is  harnessing the wisdom of the crowd to predict quantities
more accurately. To do so  we propose a Bayesian approach aimed specifically at
alleviating overfitting  a typical impediment to accurate prediction models in
practice. In particular  we develop a variational Bayesian technique for two
different worker noise models   one that assumes workers  noises are
independent and the other that assumes workers  noises have a latent low rank
structure. Our evaluations on synthetic and real world datasets demonstrate
that these Bayesian approaches perform significantly better than existing
non Bayesian approaches and are thus potentially useful for this class of
crowdsourcing problems.
