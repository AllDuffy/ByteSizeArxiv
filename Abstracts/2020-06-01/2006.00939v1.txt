Neural Architecture Search with Reinforce and Masked Attention
  Autoregressive Density Estimators
#####
Neural Architecture Search has become a focus of the Machine Learning
community. Techniques span Bayesian optimization with Gaussian priors 
evolutionary learning  reinforcement learning based on policy gradient 
Q learning  and Monte Carlo tree search. In this paper  we present a
reinforcement learning algorithm based on policy gradient that uses an
attention based autoregressive model to design the policy network. We
demonstrate how performance can be further improved by training an ensemble of
policy networks with shared parameters  each network conditioned on a different
autoregressive factorization order. On the NASBench  search space  it
outperforms most algorithms in the literature  including random search. In
particular  it outperforms RL methods based on policy gradients that use
alternate architectures to specify the policy network  underscoring the
importance of using masked attention in this setting. We have adhered to
guidelines listed in while designing experiments and reporting results. We make
our implementation publicly available.
