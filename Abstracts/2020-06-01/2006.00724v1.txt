Learning Irreducible Representations of Noncommutative Lie Groups
#####
Recent work has made exciting theoretical and practical progress towards
neural networks that are equivariant to symmetries such as rotations. However 
current techniques require explicit group representations  which generally
limits us to those groups with analytically derived matrix formulas. In this
work  we present a numerical technique for finding irreducible representations
of noncommutative Lie groups. We demonstrate that the structure of the Lie
algebras associated with these groups can be used to learn explicit
representation matrices to high precision. This provides an automated program
to build neural networks that are equivariant to a much wider class of
transformations  including previously intractable cases such as the Poincar  e
group .
