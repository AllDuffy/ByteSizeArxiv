Concept Matching for Low Resource Classification
#####
We propose a model to tackle classification tasks in the presence of very
little training data. To this aim  we approximate the notion of exact match
with a theoretically sound mechanism that computes a probability of matching in
the input space. Importantly  the model learns to focus on elements of the
input that are relevant for the task at hand  by leveraging highlighted
portions of the training data  an error boosting technique guides the learning
process. In practice  it increases the error associated with relevant parts of
the input by a given factor. Remarkable results on text classification tasks
confirm the benefits of the proposed approach in both balanced and unbalanced
cases  thus being of practical use when labeling new examples is expensive. In
addition  by inspecting its weights  it is often possible to gather insights on
what the model has learned.
