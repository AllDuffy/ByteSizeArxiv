Multi scale Cloud Detection in Remote Sensing Images using a Dual
  Convolutional Neural Network
#####
Semantic segmentation by convolutional neural networks  has advanced the
state of the art in pixel level classification of remote sensing images.
However  processing large images typically requires analyzing the image in
small patches  and hence features that have large spatial extent still cause
challenges in tasks such as cloud masking. To support a wider scale of spatial
features while simultaneously reducing computational requirements for large
satellite images  we propose an architecture of two cascaded CNN model
components successively processing undersampled and full resolution images. The
first component distinguishes between patches in the inner cloud area from
patches at the cloud s boundary region. For the cloud ambiguous edge patches
requiring further segmentation  the framework then delegates computation to a
fine grained model component. We apply the architecture to a cloud detection
dataset of complete Sentinel  multispectral images  approximately annotated
for minimal false negatives in a land use application. On this specific task
and data  we achieve a    relative improvement in pixel accuracy over a CNN
baseline based on patching.
