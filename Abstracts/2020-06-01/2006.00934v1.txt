Using competency questions to select optimal clustering structures for
  residential energy consumption patterns
#####
During cluster analysis domain experts and visual analysis are frequently
relied on to identify the optimal clustering structure. This process tends to
be adhoc  subjective and difficult to reproduce. This work shows how competency
questions can be used to formalise expert knowledge and application
requirements for context specific evaluation of a clustering application in the
residential energy consumption sector.
